/r/hillaryclinton is basically shut down. fucking hilarious. i think every post is locked.
We literally shit posted him to the White House.
#IT'S OFFICIAL, FOLKS.  #IT'S ACTUALLY FUCKING OFFICIAL!!!  *HIGH ENERGY EDIT:*  First off, I want to say that I love all of you.   We took so many hits. From the bull shit liberal media, to even fucking Reddit censoring the truth from us. #WE HAD ALL THE ODDS AGAINST US.  But guess what?  #WE FUCKING WON.  **FUCK [redacted]**, and FUCK all of those that doubted us. I'm sure we can all recount the hundreds--if not thousands--of people who called us idiots, racists, misogynists, or whatever else. They are all eating their words now, and it has never been more glorious, my friends.  I also would like to say **RIP Justice Scalia**. You are truly a legend to the highest Court. May his legacy now live on for generations.  Lastly, I am so proud to say **CONGRATULATIONS TO PRESIDENT TRUMP!!**  #MAKE. AMERICA. GREAT. AGAIN. 
#LOVE YOU ALL PEDES, WE DID IT!#

LETS FUCKING MAGA BOYS!
He did it! We did it! 
95% of this speech is him thanking everyone. 200% guaranteed Clinton would have talked about how historic it would be for a vagina to be sitting behind the desk in the oval office. 
The tears... they are so delicious.  They're all scared, but they all should know nothing bad is going to happen to legal immigrant American Muslims or legal Hispanics or any LGBTQ. We have moved past that. This is about protecting America, not about hate and division.
He beat the Democrat machine.  He beat the entire mass media, including Fox News.  He beat the #nevertrump movement.  He beat the overwhelming favorite, Jeb Bush.  He beat 16 established, seasoned political veterans.  He beat voter fraud.  He beat bullshit sexual assault allegations.  He beat the bullshit Access Hollywood tape.  He beat the final boss, the most corrupt candidate in the history of the United States, Hillary Clinton.  The only greater victory for the United States was in 1776.  #MAGA
Congratulations  America and thank you for averting WW3 with your wise choice. Your Brexit brothers are proud. Swim merrily in the briney tears of the butthurt as they accept the reality of their stupidity. Here's to the biggest fuck you in human history.
#REEEEEEEEEE
Socialist here.  Voted for Trump because I don't like criminals, even if they agree with me more than Trump might.  But truth be told, I found that I agreed with Trump more than I ever imagined I would. Tariffs on companies that outsource. Getting control of our borders. No PC bullshit. There is a lot to like about Trump, even for a socialist, if you are unwilling to be told how to think.  Edit: also, I like guns so anyone who won't try to take them is already in my good graces.

#WE DID IT!!!!!  #MAGA  #DONALD J. TRUMP IS THE 45th PRESIDENT - ELECT OF THE USA!!!!!!!!
Cmon CTR, how about one more downvote for old times sake?  I know you're not being paid and you'll be on your butt tomorrow but cmon!
Secret Service is like "Thank God, most of us won't have to guard Hillary."
Now we as Americans must unite. Trump is going to be our president and we must ALL wish that our nation succeeds and prospers.  To all Clinton supporters: now is not the time to get into hysterics. No America isn't going to end, the global economy isn't going to collapse. We are going to keep on keeping on.   Election season is over! It's finally over guys! Let's rally together and MAGA!!!!!
Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business, complicated. Thank you very much.  I've just received a call from secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It’s about us. On our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign.  I mean she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.  I mean that very sincerely. Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together, to all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.  It is time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all of Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family.  It is a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs, who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will.  Working together we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business, looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.  That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It is going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.  We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans who have been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey.  The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors.  Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It is going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We will be. We will have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.  America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country, and beautiful things and successful things once again.  I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone.  All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I would like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight a very, very historic victory.  First I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I are truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth who are here with us tonight. Where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy actually.  And my brother Robert, my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert?  My brother Robert, and they should be on this stage but that's okay. They're great.  And also my late brother Fred, great guy. Fantastic guy. Fantastic family. I was very lucky.  Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. To Melania and Don and Ivanka and Eric and Tiffany and Barron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough.  This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it is tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group.  You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all of the people that we have. Look at all of these people.  And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here, and I want to tell you it's been very, very special.  I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. He's unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings, and Rudy never changes. Where is Rudy. Where is he?  [Chanting "Rudy"]  Gov. Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician — let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he is as smart as you get, senator Jeff sessions. Where is Jeff? A great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? Is that Rudy?  Up here. Really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats, Dr. Ben Carson. Where's been? Where is Ben? By the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his familiar bring Sarah, thank you very much. Gen. Mike Flynn. Where is Mike? And Gen. Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign and there are special people. We have 22 congressional medal of honor people. A very special person who, believe me, I read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is -- that's right, how did you possibly guess? Let me tell you about Reince. I've said Reince. I know it. I know it. Look at all of those people over there. I know it, Reince is a superstar. I said, they can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win it. Like secretariat. He would not have that bust at the track at Belmont.  Reince is really a star and he is the hardest working guy and in a certain way I did this. Reince, come up here. Get over here, Reince.  Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. It's about time you did this right. My god. Nah, come here. Say something.  [Reince Priebus: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the united States, Donald Trump! Thank you. It's been an honor. God bless. Thank God.]  Amazing guy. Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we've done, so I also have to say, I've gotten to know some incredible people.  The Secret Service people. They're tough and they're smart and they're sharp and I don't want to mess around with them, I can tell ya. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down in the seat, but they are fantastic people so I want to thank the Secret Service.  And law enforcement in New York City, they're here tonight. These are spectacular people, sometimes under appreciated unfortunately, we we appreciate them. So it's been what they call an historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job and I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job. I look very much forward to being your president and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years or maybe even eight years you will say so many of you worked so hard for us, with you you will say that — you will say that that was something that you were — really were very proud to do and I can — thank you very much.  And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. We're going to get to work immediately for the American people and we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president. You will be so proud. Again, it's my honor.  It's an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period and I love this country. Thank you.  Thank you very much. Thank you to Mike Pence.

How exactly fitting is it that Hillary did not give a concession speech? THAT is who she is and how she thinks of the public. Good riddance to that nasty woman.  I am proud I helped kicked her to the curb.
It turns out that most Americans are not moronic leftists.   Surprise, surprise.

I'm so fucking drunk right now holy fuck I love you all so fucking much. I was drunkenly preparing for a Clinton victory but my home state of PA FUCKING PULLED THROUGH. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN FOLKS. I can't wait for the sjw tears mmmmm. Once again me and my roommates love you all!!!!!
It's been a long road I love you all and all your shitposting.
Brexit Bro here, this night was worth staying up 7am to see through.  Fuck the leftists/SJWs, their tears were glorious.
She couldn't even give a concession to her crowd, what a weak leader. Thank god we avoided her.
Berner here. We had a large number of disagreements (with both candidates), but the way I see it, Trump was in some ways the Bernie of the right - a populist, insurgent candidate against party incumbents. The difference is, he was able to win big league. Trump won tonight because he not only got people to vote for him, but made people actively excited for the future. He had a coherent platform and vision for the country that resonated with voters. On top of that, he was open and communicative, even off-the-cuff via his Twitter feed, and that contrasts sharply with Clinton's closely guarded persona.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that even though I may have agreed with Clinton more on policy (though not enough to vote for her), Trump was the better candidate. Congratulations, you've earned it. (and the DNC have earned this, too.)
We fucking did it. DRAIN THE SWAMP
I didn't think it would happen when I heard about Nevada early voting.   Thank you based Pennsylvania.   Thank you based Michigan.  Thank you based Wisconsin.  You made what I thought was a defeat into a land slide. 
>Obama didn't want him  >GOP didn't want him  >DNC didn't want him  >Libertarians didn't want him  >Greens didn't want him  >Trudeau didn't want him  >Merkel didn't want him  >Cameron didn't want him  >Jinping didn't want him  >le epic liberal celebrities like John Oliver, Steven Colbert and John Stewart didn't want it  >Goldman Sachs didn't want it  >JP Morgan didn't want it  >George Soros didn't want it  >a shitload of other banks and globalist financiers didn't want it  >people that label everything racist didn't want it  >the overwhelming majority of elitist out of touch assholes in the media didn't want it.   But your lads having a pint down at the pub wanted it.  Your barber down the street wanted it.  Your local plumber fixing your pipes wanted it.  The man driving you on the bus wanted it.  The people wanted it, lads.  And the people won.  [My tribute.](https://i.imgur.com/7k6AjL8.jpg)

So does this mean our sub will stay active?
While I was never a Trump supporter, I have to say that this was the strangest, most absurd, and most entertaining election I've ever seen.  Here we are, Donald is elected leader.  Is this the fall of Rome or the next Renaissance?  Only time will tell. Trump has been gifted with a Republican House and Senate (despite internal party opposition).   I'd like to mark this moment with a stake in the sand and come back in 4 years to review: Has Trump...  * built "the wall and made Mexico pay for it"? * ~~repealed~~ [renegotiated NAFTA](http://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.3244280)  * rejected the TPP * repealed Obamacare and replaced it with something "so much better" * defeated ISIS * ~~overturned Citizens United (I don't believe Trump has ever actually promised this, but there have been insinuations).~~ this appears to be incorrect, simply wishful thinking...   The ball is in your court, Trump. May god speed and good luck!

I wake up knowing that my vote, for the first time, went to the victor. And on top of that, he has a senate in his favor. Now we'll actually *have* change (looking at you, Obama) happen in the US.  Thank you so much guys. It's been a hell of a roller coaster, but we fucking did it.  - See you later, Space Cowboy

First time that I write on this sub, and I want to say WELL DONE to the Americans.  The Western world expected a clear sign of change out of you, and you have given it.   How did it happen? By miracle? I still can't believe that you managed to defeat that powerful snake of Hillary Clinton!  Great job! 
Obviously I got downvoted for saying this in /r/politics, but I think Hillary might've skipped the concession speech due to another seizure.

1. Almost all the media was against him. * Almost all the polls (except the one that predicted brexit) said he would lose. * He was attacked multiple times during his rallies by "tolerant leftist". * He was given 99% chance of NOT getting the nomination by CNN. * Hours before he was given 10% chance of winning the election, or less.    #And he won.  Man, that was quite interesting to see.

Mr. Trump, you've been on record saying the "war on drugs" has failed.   The "war on drugs" has cost the US hundreds of billons of dollars over decades. Building the wall is one way to stop the crossing of hard drugs into our country, but as some states have shown legalizing marijuana or medical marijuana has lead to tax and tourism revenue. Under a Trump administration, what will the federal stance be on recreational marijuana/medical marijuana and is there any possibility of legalization for much-needed revenue?
Mr. Trump  What is your plan for reducing or removing the influence of money on politics?

Mr. Trump, what do you feel is the greatest issue facing young Americans today?
The pictures of Americans landing on the moon is one of the most widely knows photos in the world. It shows American strength, power, and achievement.    Will you give NASA a bigger budget and allow them to to make even greater achievements, like going to Mars or building a moon base?
Strange that this AMA isn't on r/all...
Mr. Trump,  Reports estimate that 90% of US media is owned by 6 companies. The US mass media has fused into a gross alliance with big business and big government as this election has shown more than any other. The dishonest media is rigging our democracy with a radical agenda that divides Americans and causes nothing but sensationalism and hatred at the expense of the USA. They are killing our country for ratings and profit, with impunity.  How will you, as president, tackle this protected class of media elites without stepping on the first amendment rights of average Americans?
Which US president do you admire the most?
Mr. Trump is landing for his next rally and its interrupted his wifi, he will be back shortly.
Do you support the "Audit the Fed" movement?
Dear Mr. Trump,  My name is William, and I am a Nuclear Engineering student at North Carolina State University. The Democrats have treated nuclear power horribly. Nuclear power struggles to compete in the market because of unfair subsidies placed on solar and wind energy by the Democrats. Many of our plants have been shut down, and many more are expected to close in the next 20 years. The Democrats have opposed the construction of new plants, which would create many high paying jobs in construction and engineering, because they believe nuclear power is not safe, even though there have been no deaths from over 60 years of nuclear power in the United States. I want to be a part of America’s nuclear future, but I am worried about finding a stable job with all these obstacles.  Do you support American nuclear power? What are your thoughts? 
Hello Mr. Trump,   Are you getting tired of winning?

Mr. Trump, as a self-employed young American, my health insurance costs have skyrocketed under Obamacare. Paying close to $300 a month with a $6,000 deductible is a challenge as I try and grow my business. What will you do as President to ensure that myself and others can not only enjoy the security of having health insurance, but also afford to keep it?
You’ve expressed your support and appreciation for police.  What would say to a young college student like myself who is considering a job in law enforcement, but might have been discouraged by the recent attacks on police?
During your rapid fire Press Q&A this morning, you mentioned the hundreds of days it's been since Hillary's last press conference.  **What do you think is/are the reason(s) for Hillary refusing to hold any press conferences for such a huge amount of time?**  follow up,  **Do you think Hillary will attempt to decrease the number of times she has to debate you like she did to Bernie during the Democratic Primary, or even avoid debating you altogether like she's avoided press conferences altogether this year?**
Mr. Trump,   Everyday, when I leave my Manhattan office, I stop to have a friendly talk with our front desk/security manager, Larry.  Larry is an African-American man in his early 50’s, a lifelong democrat, and of the true “salt of the earth” character that makes this city and, indeed, this country, great.    For the past few months, Larry has talked almost exclusively about the election and routinely expressed fear and doubt about you as a candidate.  Today, however, for the first time, Larry said that he “liked how Trump sounded today” and now thinks "this guy could win”.    Mr. Trump, if you were to speak to Larry, a working class African-American man in his 50’s, what would you tell him as to why he should vote for you?  I promise I'll pass it along to him tomorrow.   Also, are we having the victory party in front of Trump Tower in November?  Thanks, and MAGA!
Mr. Trump,  As a Police Officer and Iraq War Vet, I want to personally thank you for showing so much incredible support towards law enforcement officers and military personnel. It means a lot!  My question: If (when) you’re elected to be the POTUS, what will you do about the Fraud, Waste and Abuse in the military? As a 10 year veteran of the armed forces, I can assure you that BILLIONS of tax payer dollars are wasted due to the unnecessary red tape and hoops the military must jump through to accomplish their mission(s). I’d rather see those billions be invested into our nation’s infrastructure! What will you do to ensure this happens?  Bonus Question – I’ve emailed your campaign and my states Republic party representatives to figure out how to get involved in your campaign to turn my blue state red and I’ve received no response! Is there someone I can reach out to? I want to do everything I can to support you to ensure we can MAGA!   Bonus Statement – Your children are very articulate and impressive speakers. I hope they consider getting involved in politics. They would represent the US very well. Extremely impressed by them.   *edit - Hijacking all these upvotes to say THANK YOU to everyone who is showing Police Officers support in these devastating times right now. We LOVE you and we APPRECIATE you for being so wonderful towards us!  
Mr. Trump, on behalf of /r/asktrumpsupporters we would like to ask you the following questions:  Question 1: We firmly believe Hillary will try and steal this election through vote fraud, especially given recent events. What is your campaign doing to ensure that we have a fair election?  Question 2: What role should NASA play in helping to Make America Great Again?  Question 3: How do you feel about WikiLeaks? Does it change your opinion on Snowden?  Question 4: What is your opinion on Net Neutrality?  Question 5: Has your campaign ever gotten any ideas from the_donald?  Thank you for taking the time to join us today and we look forward to continuing to Make America Great Again with you.   Sincerely,   /r/asktrumpsupporters- A subreddit dedicated to explaining to non-supporters why we are Trump supporters and why they should be too.  
Hello Mr. Trump, as you may know there are a lot of young Bernie Sanders supporters out there who have become disillusioned by both the conduct of the DNC and by the policy positions of Secretary Clinton (many of these Bernie Sanders frequent this site). What is the most important thing you would like to convey about yourself and your policy positions to the people who voted for Bernie in the primary but are now considering either staying home or voting third party in November?  
All you guys paying reddit for gold would be better off just donating it to Trump.
Mr. Trump, it's truly an honor.  What are your thoughts on electronic voting machines and the potential for election fraud? **It is well-known that the two major manufacturers of electronic voting machines in the U.S. —Dominion Voting and H.I.G. Capital—are supporters of Hillary Clinton and donate to the Clinton Foundation.**   I believe this represents a conflict of interest unprecedented in U.S. politics, and the only potential threat to your candidacy. Do you have plans to shine light on this issue for the rest of the country?

#**Questions and Answers so far - will keep updated**# Questions|Answers :--|:-- What is your campaign doing to ensure that we have a fair election?|Voter fraud is always a serious concern and authorities must be vigilant from keeping those from voting that are not authorized to do so.  What role should NASA play in helping to Make America Great Again?|Honestly I think NASA is wonderful! America has always led the world in space exploration. How will you, as president, tackle this protected class of media elites without stepping on the first amendment rights of average Americans?|I have been very concerned about media bias and the total dishonesty of the press. I think new media is a great way to get out the truth. Will you curb H-1B abuse and make sure visas are going to people who want to become American, stay American, and make America great?|I have put forward a detailed plan for H-1B reform to protect American workers which can viewed on the immigration paper on my website. My plan is the exact opposite of Crooked Hillary Clinton. What will you do as President to ensure that myself and others can not only enjoy the security of having health insurance, but also afford to keep it?|One of the first things I will do is to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. I will put forward an amazing new plan, which will include many reforms, such as letting people buy insurance across state lines, increasing choice and competition, and bargaining for better, cheaper drug prices. What do you think is/are the reason(s) for Hillary refusing to hold any press conferences for such a huge amount of time?|Crooked Hillary Clinton will not do press conferences because she cannot explain her illegally deleted 33,000 emails, or her disaster in Libya, or her role pushing TPP (which she would 100% approve if she got the chance), or her support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees, etc. What would say to a young college student like myself who is considering a job in law enforcement, but might have been discouraged by the recent attacks on police?|We will always stand with and support our nation's amazing police. There is nothing more honorable then serving your community and your country as a law enforcement officer. My administration will protect those who protect us. Thank you to all the incredible police officers in our country tonight. Which US president do you admire the most?|There have been many amazing Presidents in American history, including George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, all of whom I greatly admire.  What is the most important thing you would like to convey about yourself and your policy positions to the people who voted for Bernie in the primary but are now considering either staying home or voting third party in November? |Though Bernie is exhausted and has given up on his revolution, many of his voters still want to keep up the fight. I expect that millions of Bernie voters will refuse to vote for Hillary because of her support for the War in Iraq, the invasion of Libya, NAFTA and TPP, and of course because she is totally bought and sold by special interests. She and her husband have been paid millions and millions by global corporations and powerful interests who will control her every decision. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings. We welcome with open arms all voters who want an honest government and to fix our rigged system so it works for the people. This includes fixing one of Bernie's biggest issues, our terrible trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and wealth. Are you getting tired of winning?|I am never tired of winning, and as your president I will win for you, the American people. I'm with you! Mr. Trump, what do you feel is the greatest issue facing young Americans today?|The question most young people ask me is about the rising cost of education, terrible student debt and total lack of jobs. Youth unemployment is through the roof, and millions more are underemployed. It's a total disaster! I will create millions of new jobs, reform our education system, and work to free young Americans from the awful burden of debt. what do you say to people like me who are on the fence about voting 3rd party(Johnson/Stein) or for you?|Americans in every party are tired of our rigged system and corrupt politicians, and want to reform our government so it no longer benefits the powerful at the expense of everyone else. They know I will fix it so it works for them and their families. Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change. My message is that things have to change, and they have to change right now. We have to change a foreign policy that has led us to one economic disaster after another, and an economic policy that has failed our poorest citizens. We will never fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place. I am going to return the government to the people. Together, we will Make America Great Again. 
America has a proud tradition of stealing the most brilliant and talented people from countries around the world for ourselves. Albert Einstein, Wernher von Braun, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Melania Trump... the list goes on and on. In recent years, however, H-1B visa abuse has become rampant.   A program meant bring truly exceptional talent to America has been twisted by globalist politicians and corporations, allowing low-cost, short term labor to steal jobs from everyday Americans and take everything they learn back to their home countries. Will you curb H-1B abuse and make sure visas are going to people who want to become American, stay American, and make America great?

Mr Trump,  Briefly, what is your stance toward net neutrality? 
Mr. Trump, as a veteran and former employee of the NSA, I find the revelations that the agency focused on American citizens to be appalling. When I served (‘98- ‘02), we were specifically instructed NOT to target Americans and if any were involved in our data collection, we needed to contact the appropriate agency (FBI/Local law) and abort our mission immediately. What are your thoughts on the policies set that "allowed" for Americans to be secretly monitored, and what steps will you take to ensure security without compromising the rights of the American public?
You'd think a 13000+ upvoted post would last a little longer at the top of r/all but I'm seeing it near the bottom of the second page and it's barely been 2 hours.  Hmmmm

Mr. Trump,  Was there a singular moment when you thought to yourself "that's it, I have to run for President and fix this"? If so, what was it?
Many of us here believe people are misinformed about your views towards the LGBTQ community.  Could you please tell us some things you would do as President to help the LGBTQ community?
Removed from front page, top ramen.  Who woulda seen that coming.
Mr. Trump,  I was born in the United States, have no criminal background whatsoever, and have no ties to any terrorist organizations. However, the US government still collects my texts, emails, call logs, etc. through the NSA. Do you believe this information helps fight terrorism? Why or why not? Do you believe this violates my Fourth Amendment right against warrantless searches of my property?   Thanks and MAGA!
#Trump's AMA has just been taken off /r/all. Have a look.
Hello Mr. Trump,  I am currently an undergraduate college student. In recent years, free speech on college campuses have quickly become an issue. Political discourse is dominated by liberal-minded thinkers and colleges have become increasingly hostile towards right-leaning students like myself. We have seen this madness with the student protests in Mizzou and Yale last year. My concern is that we might be seeing the start of a disturbing political trend. Some of these students will be our future politicians and I’m afraid that our civil liberties will be compromised in the future for the sake of political correctness. My question to you is what can you do as president to help mitigate the growing polarization in our country, especially in environments like college campuses?  
11k upvotes and 20k comments and I have to scroll down pages and pages on my phone to find this AMA, seriously Reddit? I'm not even a Trump fan but this is clear bias.
Mr. President Trump, sir. His Nimbleness. 2017-2025, His Golden Lionself. Thank you for gracing us with your presence.  My question is about:  #**WAR ON DRUGS**  The war on drugs has been a total disaster, particularly the war on marijuana. Colorado has seen great success with legalization and regulation of recreational weed. History teaches us that prohibition only makes things worse by creating black markets. "Medicinal" weed would only serve to make billions for the pharmaceutical industry/lobbyists. Do you agree or disagree? And how would you tackle this issue on a federal level?
This is gone from /r/all...
Hello Mr. Trump,  Where do you like to get your news and information from?  I was wondering, since you think most of the mainstream media is biased and incompetent, if you follow any independent news sources, like Breitbart or Regated, that have stepped up to cover your campaign more accurately?

Mr. Trump,  I'm a legal immigrant and a US citizen for the past 10 years. My entire family was so happy to finally see someone talking about the illegal immigration issue seriously on the national stage.  Obviously the most glaring problem is the nearly open Mexican border, but I want to know if you have plans to deal with the other avenues used by illegal immigrants.  For example, nearly 500k people overstayed their temporary visas in 2015. That number is sure to increase massively once the border routes are cut off.  What are your thoughts on dealing with this issue?
Hello Donald, my question concerns NASA. I feel NASA is an important program to keep the United States competitive with the rest of the world. They are under constant fear of being defunded, and we are using the Russians for rides to ISS. Can you clarify your stance on NASA?
Mr. Trump, I’m very excited to see you as our 45th President of the United States and I truly believe this will be the case. Your views, while strong, are what this country needs to steer us away from an otherwise bleak and ‘politically correct’ future.  My question to you is: As President, how will you handle Edward Snowden? Do you still truly believe he’s a traitor to the American people or do you see how he’s been able to expose just how totalitarian our federal government treats our Citizens’ privacy?  Thanks so much for doing this AMA with us today!
Wow. Some serious Reddit fuckery going on with this post.  As of now, it's on the 3rd page of /r/all with 11,000+ points, and 63% upvoted after <2 hours.   The 2nd post on the front page of /r/all has 7,000+ points, 80% upvoted, and is over **5 hours** old.   Looks like the new "more inclusive" algorithm is doing its job.   **edit**   Wow. The fuckery is of epic scale. the EnoughTrumpSpam post is currently at #2, with 4,000+ points, 55%, and also <2 hours. Even if subbed upvotes are worth less, it can't possibly account for the discrepancy.

Mr. Trump,  As a manual laborer I have seen repeated mass layoffs/terminations of staff that were born here, only for the jobs to be filled with the cheapest immigrants management can find.   My question to you as someone who's seen our blue collar jobs go from middle class Americans to our factories going overseas and the ones remaining getting filled with the cheapest labor they can find.  What do you see as the future of blue collar work in America?  
MIGA - Make the Internet Great Again!   America's internet costs more and does less than in [many other countries](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/internet-u-s-compare-globally-hint-slower-expensive/). We used to be first. Sad.   We stopped being first when the free market got destroyed for American Internet. Consumers used to have choices. ISPs used to have competition.   You know the great things that free market capitalism can do. But we need a free market for that to happen. The ISPs have local monopolies or duopolies that have strangled the free market. I have seen two proposals for fixing this:   1) Separate ISPs from the "last mile". The companies that physically connects you is separate from the companies that provide service. This way, even if you only have one (i.e. cable or fiber) connection, you will still have access to multiple ISPs (providers). This strategy has been used successfully in the alcohol industry. See the [three tier system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-tier_system_(alcohol_distribution\)). This would restore competition and the free market.   2) Regulate ISPs as a utility and force them to wholesale services to competitors. This will also create competition. For examples of wholesale services providing competition see the cellphone industry's [MVNOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator). Also see the [Telecommunications Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996#Framework) which required the telcos to allow competitors access to their local lines at regulated wholesale rates.   3) Use local municipalities to lay down their own fiber (i.e. the last mile) and run [Open Access Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-access_network) in which any ISP can provide service to any customer. This has been successfully done in Galax, VA (see [The Wired Road](http://www.thewiredroad.net/node/2)) and Danville, VA.   We know competition is the answer thanks to Google Fiber. When Google Fiber comes to town suddenly the incumbents can offer [faster speeds](http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/04/google-fiber-plans-expansion-then-twc-makes-speeds-six-times-faster/) and [lower prices](https://consumerist.com/2015/03/30/att-charges-40month-more-for-fiber-internet-if-google-isnt-in-your-town-yet/).   Personally, I prefer option 1 as it gives the government the least power while restoring the free market. There also may be other options I am unaware of.   American voters are [very dissatisfied](http://www.theacsi.org/news-and-resources/press-releases/press-2015/press-release-telecommunications-and-information-2015) with the poor service and high cost caused by a lack of competition.   What is your plan to MIGA?

Good Evening Mr. Trump,  Air Force Officer here.  The proposal by the Senate Armed Services Committee, and championed by Sen. McCain, would drastically cut Basic Allowance for Housing for our Active Duty troops of all branches.  Many young Airmen that I have talked to would seriously consider leaving the service if these cuts were made.  Our troops are relatively under-compensated compared to their civilian counterparts, especially in non-combat roles such as contracting and engineering.  The politically correct culture now has infiltrated the Armed Services, and frequently acts as ankle weights for those in leadership.  It keeps good ideas from being shared and acted upon and penalizes troops for very small missteps.  Mr. Trump, my question to you is, what is your plan to support and retain the fine folks serving in our military?   V/R,  Lt WVUme
Mr. Trump,  I’d like to address the elephant in the room and say that you LIED sir! You told me I would get tired of winning and I’m NOT EVEN CLOSE!  My question is related to nuclear energy: I’ve watched nearly every rally but I haven’t seen you mention nuclear energy too much. What do you think about aggressively building nuclear plants in this country so that we can be completely energy independent?  Also, I’d like to say, from the bottom of my heart, that we’re with you. When you said that “we’re a team” during the convention it felt genuine. I hope you know that we’re with you 100%. We ARE a team. We’ve got people at this very moment manually going through the DNC e-mails looking for felonies, we’ve people manually looking through Hillary’s e-mails, we’ve got people analyzing and mapping out all the connections of the Clinton Foundation, we’ve got people posting and sharing your tweets everywhere - everyone is doing their best to get you into the Whitehouse. We’ve got your back Mr. Trump! We’re with you until the end!

 Mr. Trump,  My family legally immigrated to this country and we are all voting for you. We think that immigration is a very important issue and we want everyone coming in to follow the rules just like we did. However, the legal immigration system is currently a mess and encourages illegal immigration. What is your plan to reform the legal immigration system? 
Wait, they're censoring on Reddit?  WTF?  
As president what will you do about the blatant censorship from powerhouses like google who "coincidentally" remove negative things from search suggestions for the candidate (Hillary) that they support? And pushes negative articles about candidates they don't like?  google is almost monopolistic in how much power it has and can sway many people intentionally on any subject. We have proof as google's Eric Schmidt pumps money into startups that are helping Hillary.
Hello Mr. Trump. Over the past few years, the future of space exploration has come into question with the cancellation of the Space Shuttle, the rise of new aerospace companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, and the race to Mars. Additionally, NASA and its latest project, the Space Launch System, have been criticized as inefficient and wasteful because the program is costing billions while being delayed for years.  What are your thoughts on the current state of the private space industry? What are your plans as president for NASA, especially in regard to the question of its current role in space exploration?
**Mr. Trump,  Reports estimate that 90% of US media is owned by 6 companies. The US mass media has fused into a gross alliance with big business and big government as this election has shown more than any other. The dishonest media is rigging our democracy with a radical agenda that divides americans and causes nothing but sensationalism and hatred at the expense of the USA. They are killing our country for ratings and profit, with impunity.  How will you, as president, tackle this protected class of media elites without stepping on the first amendment rights of average americans?  PS: I went to your Houston rally, it was burning and I was one of the last ones in but it was worth it to see you speak, thank you so much! MAGA!**
Mr. Trump,  I am a family physician. Many physicians are becoming increasingly frustrated as we watch government regulations and mandates invade the physician-patient relationship, to the detriment of healthcare. Insurance and hospital corporations have been just as damaging for the same reasons, chasing out the traditionally independent physician, and eroding physician autonomy. How will you return control of medicine in the United States back to the physicians, so that we can spend more time treating our patients, and less time being mired in red tape?

To the untrained eye, if often seems that your actions as a candidate are very off-the-cuff and unplanned. However, many here have perceived a very intricate methodology to many of them, with a great deal of them revealing hidden depth as time goes on, or casually subverting the untrained mind into patterns of thinking that lead them to question their long-held beliefs. This “4D Chess”, as we refer to it here, has confounded your opponents throughout your campaign, most recently leading Hillary Clinton to reveal that her emails may have sensitive information in an illegal fashion.   How much thought do you put into these complex and nuanced words and actions? Do you have to make an effort to plan them, or do they just naturally come to you?

This AMA is currently on page 9 of /r/all. Meanwhile the admins are projecting by using vote bots to post a painting of a naked Trump to /r/enoughtrumpspam to bring it to #2 of /r/all.   #There is no censorship on Reddit. Reddit does not have an agenda.
Mr. Trump, do you think that there is going to be issues with voter fraud on election day? And if you do, do you have any plans to counter it?
Wow this post dropped down to #36 and /r/enoughtrumpspam gets ahead of this. Fucking reddit bias.
#Hello Mr. (future) President! **I have 3 topics I would love to hear your thoughts on! Feel free to answer all or some!**  #Space Exploration  What are your thoughts about America’s future in space exploration and what role will the Trump administration have in it? Assuming budgeting allows it,  * 1) Would the Trump government be open to expanding manned or unmanned American space exploration?  * 2) What about projects like the Orion spacecraft?  * 3) Would work towards a Mars (or another moon) mission be accelerated?  #Breaking up Trusts  Do you have any plans for antitrust laws? In the past, America had laws aimed at preventing a small number of hands from pulling the strings of very large monopolistically competitive corporations. These companies, such as Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, crushed competition and held far too much power. So, then president Roosevelt enacted antitrust laws to break up these monopolies as best he could. Today, we have multiple monopolistically competitive corporations that are far bigger than Standard Oil ever was and hold far more sway over the public psyche than any of the monopolies of the past ever could. The essence of Capitalism is healthy competition so,  * 1) As president would you consider bringing back real antitrust legislation against monopolistic companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc? They have no loyalty to any nation and many are run by megalomaniacs that will do anything to line their pockets. They may be private companies but they provide a public service.  * 2) Would you consider enacting antitrust laws against media conglomerates such as News Corp? A few men and their friends control a massive number of media outlets all over the world and they get to decide the narrative. Would you be willing to support bringing back legislation that limited the number of media outlets that one person/group could be allowed to own?  * 3) [Your campaign has pointed out that The Washington Post has been used by Jeff Bezos of Amazon for political purposes.](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-campaign-statement-regarding-the-washington-post) Would you be willing to support independent journalistic integrity by restoring past legislation restricting the owners of big businesses from using their own media holdings for their own political/financial purposes?   #Cybersecurity  This is an issue that is not very well know or discussed by politicians because it doesn’t provide much political capital with voters, but it is nonetheless very important to our national and personal security. Chinese (and others) hackers routinely hack American companies involved in science, research, and engineering and steal technologies developed by them. Our government does little to prevent this. Many companies collect and store personal data from customers and don’t enact proper security protocols to maintain its privacy. Just look at the DNC and Crooked Hilary!  * 1) As president would you support legislation defining some sort of security protocols that companies would be obligated to follow to insure the security of their data?  * 2) Do you think methods like personal encryption make us safer from malicious individuals (or governments) or do they make us unsafe by preventing law enforcement from doing their job?  #Bonus  **What do you think about /r/The_Donald?**  If you haven't figured it out, this subreddit consists of a lot of young folks and the immaturity clearly shows. What are your thoughts?  Thank you for doing this AMA. MAGA!
WE HAVE (this post) BEEN REMOVED FROM  R/ALL?

#STOP GIVING HIM REDDIT GOLD AND DONATE TO THE CAMPAIGN INSTEAD
aw I missed such a historic AMA  edit: someone in the year 2020 who sees this tell me how things went ok? do we have self driving cars yet? are smartphones still popular? how were trump's first 4 years?
**#THIS AMA IS BEING CENSORED BY REDDIT, PLEASE DO NOT CONTINUE SUPPORTING THEM BY BUYING GOLD.**
fuck reddit, this has been yanked from /r/all
 I'm not an US citizen but here are few questions:  1. Have you ever considered including Poland in the Visa Waiver Program?  2. Will you make Ben Carson Secretary of Health?  3. Are you planning to decrease Nuclear Arsenal?  4. Do you think that Russian membership in NATO can be possible? 
#REDDIT IS NOT CENSORING THIS AMA! (they are)
That AMA was shorter than little marco.

Mr Trump, never did I think we would have a major candidate running for president who was opposed to globalist practices such as NAFTA, TPP, and open borders. Could you expand upon when you first began to be skeptical of these ideas, and what lead you to being pro-American sovereignty? Would a Trump Administration place the United States Constitution above any international agreement, including the UN Charter?

How is /enoughtTrumpspam tranding right now on reddit and not The_Donald?? 
Mr. Trump,  Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA. I'll be upfront and say that I am not a supporter of yours. That being said, I am very open to reasonable political discourse.  While I consider myself lucky to have work and a high level of education, I am faced with a number of issues not generally discussed.  1. Benefits for the self-employed are difficult. Do you support the separation of insurance and employment? And, what steps would you take to ensure those without traditional employment have access to health care? 2. I am a biomedical scientist-engineer by training. Are you satisfied with the current levels of federal grant funding available? And, what specific plans do you have regarding academic and corporate-sponsored research? 3. Self-employment taxes are high. What steps will you take to reduce the tax burden of the self-employed? (who pay the highest marginal tax rate) 4. Despite living in categorical poverty, I did not receive a large amount of federal or private support for my education. This forced me to take on a significant amount of student loans. Income-based repayment has helped, but is not enough. What options do you support for reducing the burden for high capital, low-wage student loanees? Do you support discharge of loans via Chapter 7 bankruptcy? 5. Most discussions are set around those living in urban and suburban areas. What will you do to support those of us living in rural America?  Thank you!
For this AMA we have temporarily taken extra security measures to keep our community free from troublemakers. We built the wall 10 ft taller, you might say.  Comments from brand new accounts are among those that will be removed by the automoderator. Accounts that are less than 30 days old AND that have less than 500 combined karma are ineligible and their comments will be automatically removed. Public figures who support Trump may circumvent this by [sending me a private message]( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=TheModelRedditor) that includes a link to their verified twitter profile, then following us on twitter ([@theDonaldReddit]( https://twitter.com/TheDonaldReddit)).   Please note that the rules of this subreddit DO apply (see our sidebar) and that our moderators will be strictly enforcing our rules during the AMA. Those who are not eligible to post at /r/The_Donald may still ask questions over at /r/AskTrumpSupporters. 
Do you watch [the "You Can't Stump the Trump" montage series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF1IFz7llUyYuB-IRNy8fu7orq0_B5sWe) on YouTube?    You have once [tweeted out one particular video](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/653856168402681856), but I wasn't sure if you watched any of the other ones in the series.
President Trump, we apologize that reddit has rejected you. Maybe this could be a talking point about more censorship and bias.
**TO ALL OF THE HILLARY SHILLS....**  #THERE'S NO STUMPIN' WHAT CAN'T BE STUMPED.
What will you do concerning the funding of space programs when you become president?
What was the final straw, Mr. Trump? What was the final weight that tipped the scales towards your running for president? If I'm not mistaken, you've been considering it in some form or other for quite a few years now.
Mr. Trump I thank you for taking the time to visit the most enthusiastic and motivated place on internet when it comes to making you the next President.   My Question is one that gets left behind in the politics of today.  ~~IF~~ **WHEN** you become the next President what are your plans on improving the funding to NASA and revitalizing our space program?   Thank you! -Mike
I know you are pro NASA, will you put a man on mars?
Hello, Mr. (Future) President!   In a 1988 interview with Oprah Winfrey, you said you wouldn't run for president unless "Things got so bad, I could never rule it out completely." My question to you is, what was that seminal moment? The exact moment when you could no longer sit on the sidelines and watch America continue to go down the tubes.

Mr Trump, have you visited /r/the_donald before? If so, has it helped with your political campaign? If not, do you plan on visiting here again?
The New Algorithm Was Designed To Keep President Trump From The Front Page... But Sadly, That Won't Happen.
Can anyone eli5 with this vote fuzzing and why we have 10k and 16k uptendies on our threads?
We are going to lose our minds once we get real pics of him in the oval office
Upvote everything!
fuck the front page of reddit. DONALD J. TRUMP IS GOING TO BE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE WORLD. 
I'm not sure about that.  The_donald isn't in the top 200 on my front page.  I had to come here to figure out what's going on.  Definitely some censorship going on.  AGAIN, this is my home page not r/all.  Edit: I came back 2 hours later and checked again.  I stopped looking after I found not one the_donald post in my top 700 on my home page.  2nd Edit:  On r/all there's one T_D post at #2. But if logged out and go with incognito mode the #2 post disappears all together and T_D no more.

The points are increasing on all posts so it's hard to tell, but our points have been cut in half compared to other subs.
Him looks so big like a president of small town. 
I just saw this on all, good job guys!! 
Ok, unrelated, but some leftist cuck (not naming names) keeps calling me a conspiracy nut and is constantly making fun of my family's health, and he's lying, as per usual of their agenda. I've reported him for taking jabs at my family, but how do I deal with people like him? What do I say?
This sub makes me very happy, ya'll get so much shit from other subreddits and trump every single one of them singlehandley. Literally destroying /r/politics and /r/enoughtrumpspam right now. I love you guys.
Trump 2016
WE ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN WE COULD EVER IMAGINE!  HAIL GLORY!  PRAISE KEK!
There's only one front page for me. Things in this sub have always made sense. I have peaked outside this sub before but sounds scary with all the people hold so much control and are so self involved. I just want to have fun. Spread the love and MAGA.

To much energy cant handle, system overload
I can't wait until we get an actual picture of him in the Oval Office. I WILL POST IT EVERYWHERE.
Everytime I see or hear the words "President Trump" I just can't help but get the biggest smile on my face.
That desk looks a bit small on him.. We may need to upgrade it... *BIGLY*
This change is only a user interface change, not a sorting or scoring change. 
###----> TOP BANTER   BANTER   BANTER   BANTER   BANTER
It's just astonishing how much disrespect people are showing for our new President
Downvote bots hitting hard tonight eh? Fuck these low energy shills. 
##REDDIT MOBILE USERS: DOUBLE TAP COMMENTS TO UPVOTE THEM
We're back, bitches. 
Correction: the update was to keep "positive" stories about trump off front page. ''Tis a key difference. It is all ok tho because we are gonna keep winning 
All the libs just dropped their collective tendies.
Let's make reddit great again!
Bout time T_D got back up to the Front Page... For a second I thought that they would be censored. Disaster avoided
This is pretty funny, we can concentrate focus up votes to one thread and get front page again with sucess.  But we fall off pretty quick, so then another thread has to be updooted
"Huh, wonder what the effects of that *algorithm* were anyway"  > 22.7k uptrumps  The more you know

The God Emperor is gonna smash that coffee table when he choke slams Obama on Jan 20th
When did we forget the terms   #-HIGH ENERGY   #-NO BRAKES!   and others? Just because we won doesn't mean we stop. The trump train won't stop until we reach the white house ^(for the second time.)
Jesus dude. 14k upvotes. This really puts our side in perspective.
Dammmmmn 15k upvotes!
Wow. I was getting ready for bed, but the energy on this post is INSANE. 21,186 UPVOTES. HOLY COW GUYS. MEME FUCKING MAGIC. THIS IS HOW IT STARTS.

You're goddamn right it won't. This backlash has done more to increase his popularity than anything else. We want to see what all the fuss is about-and then we stay. 
Bleep bloop Russian upvote bot checking in.

Holy shittt 21k up votes? BLOWN THE FUCK OUT CTR

Actually i think it was implemented to keep the PGATE stuff off Reddit.. funnily enough i haven't seen a single post about it since...
[Just a little higher!](https://i.sli.mg/ogg6Oq.png)
I dont know why but I feel like this Sub has gotten a lot funner since the stickies were removed. I dont know if others feel this way or if its just my imagination. 
STILL NOT STUMPED
Jesus that fucking sweet sweet karma...
I honestly don't think you could write a better comedy then what is going on with Reddit.   It is truly a comedy of errors.
Reddit is such a pigfuck
Almost 20,000 upvotes?! Holy fuck. I'm fairly new to this subreddit but I know that's way beyond what is normally shown. Incredible

I don't even post here but I come daily to give you my upvotes, fight those evil asshole cunts trying to keep you down guys!

sadly when i open reddit on mobile The_Donald never appears.
This is third on r/all at the moment. Yeah I don't think the new algorithm had that in mind....

I wish I could upvote twice 
I saw 23.9k and really hoped my little orange arrow would be the 24,000th brick on this wall.
Dont see this on the front page anymore.   edit: r/all
#NO BRAKES
Wow the train is so fast its unreal
Almost 30k upvotes!!!!! More energy!!!!!!! 
Resolute! 
They can keep our posts from the front page but they can't keep our President from the White House.
It may have been conceived that way, but it really just means more subs will follow our model.  WE WIN EVEN WHEN THEY STOP US
Every time I read about Clinton "having the right to challenge the ellectoral college vote" I cringe... FUCK THAT CUNT! FUCK HER RIGHT IN HER CUM DUMPSTER!!!
mass media was designed to keep trump out of the white house too...  but that didn't work, did it?
I up vote every single thing on the front two pages.  Gotta fight the shills
I bet Reddit's BoD hates us all so much. Which is good. Screw them.
He looks BIG
Fuck that motherfucker looks presidential goddam he is intimidating
What new algorithm?
Funny how his reflection isn't on the desk, but the chair's is. 
16.4k lol

Remember when CNN coached the post debate panel on what they should say?  That's fake news and a completely dishonest perversion of "journalism"
Haven't heard anything about that Russian hack on the election since the electoral college voted.. For an issue that dominated CNN's air time last week and hasn't been resolved, why go silent
Right now a segment from Tucker Carlson on Fox destroying their latest fake news story. Which has actually hurt an American business (Delta Airlines), with at least one celebrity tweeting at an army of followers that "never again she'll fly on Delta".  Stupid,dangerous CNN, seems provoking a race war isn't enough now, I hope they'll get sued.

MSNBC should really be up there too. They literally had a front page thing today about how the biggest "winner of the election" was Putin, because they accomplished something Russia or the USSR hadn't ever been able to do, install a Manchurian candidate since they "hacked the election." Dude was 100% serious, not joking at all.  I feel like intelligence and reason was thrown out this election over a "smear Trump at all costs, ethics be damned" mentality. Intellectual dishonesty galore.  CNN is just as bad, if not worse. We need to get MSNBC into the number 2 position, imo.
CNN is fake news.  CNN is completely fake news.  If there ever was a fake news, it would be CNN.  I 100% know CNN to provide only FAKE NEWS.  The epidemic of fake news coming out of CNN is astounding.  How much Fake News could a Fake News channel Fake if a Fake News channel could Fake News?  I don't know....ask CNN.
Congrats CNN. That's quite an accomplishment!!

I'm so disappointed in you, Bryan Cranston! Miley Cyrus, on the other hand, will certainly not be missed.

Samuel L Jackson is the only one I'd miss from that list. I actually felt betrayed when he said that.  Sam, you made your bed. Now you must lie in it.  Edit: I was tired, u/Wilreadit 
Podesta told everyone to go home!!! He knows HIllary is too drunk to give her speech tonight.

Please not to Canada, this country is over-capacity for liberal morons.
**GET THE FUCK OUT, SCUM**
The video of Bryan Cranston talking about how Donald Trump will lose the election and should go away for awhile, is beginning to look very cringeworthy
This is fucking fantastic I am having so much fun 
Lena Dunham is on there twice. Does that mean we deport her twice?
NBC is now blaming the Russians. LMFAO.

Eh, they won't. The money is too good in the US, plus this has given them a whole lot more material  (if they are "comedians"). But I would love to see one follow through with it at least.

I'm betting a few of them at most change their residence to some summer house in another country but spend most of their time here and of course live off of American industry.
Canadian here. We don't want your leftovers celebrities. Send them elsewhere.
lol like a president is gonna affect any of their multimillion dollar lifestyles. They're so detached from anyone who would be affected by either candidate's policies
Good morning America! Congratulations are in order! Now the real work starts - drain the swamp!    Btw, Don't forget all those angry muslims, who promised to go back home.   Just don't send them to EU. We got enough problems.  Once more, awesome job electing someone else than a career politician.  
I've consulted with every other Canadian and we've agreed that the only name off that list we'll accept is Bryan Cranston. The others can go fuck off someplace else. We don't want them. 
#Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham GTFO
Just to inform you guys that Lady Gaga staged protest outside Trump Tower.  She was then pictured looking emotional in a luxury black Rolls-Royce Phantom being driven away.  Poor Ga Ga :< 
Can we add jay z and beyonce to this list?
http://HaveYouMovedToCanadaYet.com is keeping track of all of these celebrities and their departures. :)

Why are you going to Canada? Turn around, go to Mexico. I thought you weren't xenophobic? 
You put Amy Shumer on twice.    She should be on at least 3 times
Can Cranston stay tho?

#CUCKS WILL BE ETERNALLY BTFO
I came.          I saw          I came again.    
Gentlemen,  I have generally been a lurker here.  I did not start out as a Trump guy, but I came to the faith earlier than most.  I am a young professional with a beautiful wife and two young boys that are going to be much better men than me one day.  For the better part of a year now I would watch them sleep and fight back tears because I was scared to death of the world that they would grow up in because I was convinced that hope was lost.  Watching the enthusiasm on this board renewed my hope that there was still a sane majority in this country that understood the basics of American exceptionalism and the free market, something that Mr. Trump has epitomized better than I would have ever expected.  What I saw here gave me hope for the future. And what I see tonight has crystallized it.  When I go in to look at my boys tonight my heart will be at peace for the first time since either of them have been born and all of you deplorable shit-posting pedes can claim thanks for that peace.  God Bless America!  For God and County, fucking MAGA!  Edit: formatting, been drinking victory scotch... 
# FUTURE HISTORIANS, HEED THIS: YOU DO NOT BULLY AN ENTIRE COUNTRY INTO ACCEPTING A SHITTY, CORRUPT CANDIDATE.

**THE POWER OF WEAPONIZED AUTISM**

They're right about the "shy Trump voter", or more specifically the "persecuted Trump voter" who has been called all sorts of names by the MSM/Hollywood/etc for most of this year and didn't even want to show their support in public for fear of vandalism or assault.   The sleeping giant has awoken..

Just enjoying this again... Do you remember where you were on Nov 8, 2016?
PA just went from 99% counted to 89%?
It's not a win for me until I see that 270. I am absolutely on edge.
Appreciate our glorious win. Dont be insulting though. We want everyone to appreciate the greatness of a Trump presidency. Dont alienate everyone who did not vote for him from day one.
We did it! We won! We stopped our nation from being taken over by a criminal! 
lol at these guys on fox trying to figure out how hillary can still win 
LOL THE BANNER ON THIS SUB. NO BRAKES
We are up slightly in PA.... BUT THE LAST REMAINING COUNTY WITHOUT RESULTS IS LEBANON WHICH VOTED 64% FOR ROMNEY!!! 
96.4 REPORTED IN PENNSYLVANIA TRUMP UP .5
Hows Mark Cuban holding up?
I waivered. I'm sorry. I flip flopped so much between candidates, in my comments and thoughts.    But when it came down to the booth decision I chose trump. Nj lost for trump but I chose him. I feel proud, like when my dad chose Reagan. Hope you are too. God bless my friends 
1.5% left in PA and Trump still holds a 70k lead.  http://www.electionreturns.pa.gov/ENR_NEW  Why haven't they called it?

Is Crooked Hillary a new Reddit admin?
If something should happen to Trumps picture, what picture is next in line? I'm not suggesting anything WOULD happen to Trump's picture, or that anyone SHOULD DO something to Trump's picture.  I am just curious if this is a way that could possibly get the picture of the last black president on here?

Reddit is tired of so much winning
The admins are fucking up the system. 
One would think they would at least do it in a subtly manner so it was questionable...
I think this was their way at getting back at us. We say the most upvoted post in history....so they make it a zero.  In a strange way, this sums up exactly why the Donald won.  Regular people got sick of bullshit coming from elites with too much power.  And what do you know?  It even manifests itself on Reddit.

The Donald is so under budget he hit the front page of /all with zero upvotes! That's efficient karma management! 
This has literally never happened before. The post had several thousand upvotes and went to 0 in minutes. It's not "some people" downvoting. It's the admins fucking with posts because they're butthurt.

They gave the bullshit excuse of downvotes taking it off all lol. 
Any chance at all it could have been a coincidence? Or do we know the admins are cucks? Salty cucks. 
How much of a low energy loser do you have to be to post in subreddits where you hate the content?  I know cucks enjoy watching their girlfriend get fucked by another man but the pathetic levels should have limits.
I find your attempt to feign superiority to be far more adorable.
Odd it isn't working that way on picture 2-400.
Honestly, I can't think of any way that it was a coincidence unless another subreddit directed the attack. If that's the case, then it's brigading on a massive scale which the admins allowed. If not, then the admins did it personally. In both cases, the admins are at fault.

HANDING IN MY HISTORY COMMENT. 
*We're gonna trigger cucks for 8 years, folks. Big League!*
Thank you for reminding why I need to block this sub 👍
In case you didn't get an answer The Donald had a post that was on front page of r/all and we watched the mods take it to 0 so it would go away. Reddit mods and admins have been censoring the group for a while now and this is in retaliation. 
I cant speak for a lot of people but I can talk for myself. My parents are both white (legal) immigrants and I was born in the lower middle class. They both worked hard to try and provide for me and now I work hard to try and help provide for them. I've never seen "white privilege". I've seen the opposite if anything. I got bullied during most of my school for being the "white kid". Now I get yelled at by these people born to money and never knowing what being hungry feels like that I'M privileged. That I have a easy life and that I am oppressing minorities when in the area I live in im the minority. Then this guy runs for president and the same people say the same things about him and the people voting for him so I read into it. He starts to see like a better and better idea. Now I'm shit posting memes on a reddit page while I watch the media have a temper tantrum about the people voting in someone they believe in.
#JOKES ON YOU CUCKEDDIT

And I bet u look like gods gift to creation when ur that age. 👌 spez: and even w his looks he still bag more pussy than ur lifetime
WEEEWOOOWEEEWOOOWEEEWOOO DEPORT DEPORT
HAHAHAH You can't block the fact that Donald Trump is president. Burying your head in the sand won't help. Instead, learn why he won, learn the legit reasons people voted for him instead of dehumanizing your enemy. 
lets be honest, you probably won't be blocking the sub if you haven't already. Your life would just be too dull!
Reddit Mods and Admins*
People say the same things about Donald Trump? And you relate to that. So youre voting for home because he is a minority because he is rich?
Can't Jolt the Coult  Can't Fence The Pence
You bring up very valid points, but I wouldn't be blocking the sub because of Trump being president (if that was the reason I would have done that in November lol). The reason is because you are spamming r/all and it diminishes other people's experience.
Lol you know I was going to block it after the election in order to disengage with politics, but I figured that it'd do me some good to try and come to terms with it all. But come on man 20 of the same all on the front page is Spam and diminishes the Reddit experience.   I'll have to admit though that does definitely take coordination and effort, so good on y'all for that.
Hes trying to do things for his country and I respect that. I'm just talking about my area about the white minority. I can't even vote yet but hey every little bit of help matters right? 
> and now look at it, r/all completely back to normal. They have and now look at it, r/all completely back to normal. They have their outbursts every now and again but they really are the minority on Reddit. It's not like they can hold the high ground for any amount of time 
It's official: Trump will become the first U.S. President to support gay marriage starting from Inauguration Day. (What a shame if this reached /r/all)
barry didn't even back it until 2011 when the gays got their rights in state legislatures and state courts WITHOUT his help. it would have ended up being legalized federally with or without barry's support
[removed]
And yet LGBT friends of mine are STILL against Trump on this issue, I swear they disregard the fucking facts and make Trump's stances up out of the blue
People don't give Trump credit for appreciating the checks and balances within gov't. Everything he proposes he says how he'll accomplish it without overstepping the constitution.
MRW http://i.imgur.com/naNeoEc.jpg
I saw a post on r/lgbt claiming that we're trying to "gaslight" people by saying trump has always supported same-sex marriage  #Anyone who's paid attention knows that he, personally, is against it but believes the decision is done. He accepts that. TL;DR trump doesn't want to get gay married  Obama, meanwhile.... there's some gaslighting for you
If this doesn't shut up the cries of "anti-LGBT" then I don't know what will.
OP for the sake of accuracy, Obama actually said this in 2008.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6K9dS9wl7U  
I've been a homophobe all my life but I've come to love my homosexual brothers and sisters.  There was such unjustified fear and hate inside of me which I've regretted thoroughly all these years and if I could go back to 16-year-old me I would kick the shit out of him for being a deluded asshat.   Perhaps its the cheap brandy but I feel this is a time to apologise for whatever transgressions I'd committed against other human beings.  I've realised that whether you like dicks or pussy has absolutely no bearing on your value as a person. And on topic, I wish these rabid liberals would accept some of their own faults and possibly change for the greater good.
You know what I like most about this, he didn't even let his personal opinion get involved. That's his fucking job, the courts decided so it's over with in his mind. Even if he doesn't agree with it, the courts and the people have spoken.  **That's some shit a president ought to say.**
#**Obama was in the office when same-sex marriage was legalized, all of a sudden, Barack is a saint!**
He is also likely to have the first openly gay person on his staff with Peter Thiel. 
I'm a simple man.   I see 'What a shame if' and I smack the up button 
It's funny how the folks that are classically "anti-establishment" are Anti-Trump. Perhaps if they abstained from their daily dose of "progressive/liberal" propaganda, then they will see Trump for who he is.    He is disruptive of the status quo. He is the anti-bullshit, "call it as it as is" leader of the free world.   He wasn't called a racist until he ran against a democrat. He loves our country more than he loves his lifestyle.   So fuck all of you that need to manufacturer a bad guy to hate while wearing the latest hipster glasses and wool cap.   He is going to fight for every American - whether that fits your "progressive bullshit narrative" or not.  
Anyone protesting while waiving the LGBT flag right now is a disgrace. I really hope they are just misinformed. You are protesting a guy that was more open to gay marriage than Obama? 
Yep, Obama was against gay marriage. No one ever brings it up though.
I am convinced this man doesn't know how to be wrong.   Everything he does has positive impact. 
No one is coming to take your gays.
Trump is all about America first. If you are American or legally wish to be one, you have nothing to fear.  If on the other hand you are a corrupt politician, terrorist or a border hoping, job stealing criminal that doesn't aspire to be a citizen, then your days are numbered. 
**BUT THIS DOESN'T FIT MY NARRATIVE!!!!**  **REEEEEEEEEEE**
I voted for Gore, Kerry and Obama 1.0. Donated to Kerry and Obama. I proudly supported Trump and donated as much as I legally could. I pissed off a few neighbors with my political signs too.  I was lucky enough to see him in person. When he says he will make America great again, he believe it to his core, without a doubt. He was ridiculed for 18 months and has been call every name in the book. He never wavered and  didn't even flinch.  The man just keeps winning. He wins because that is all he knows how to do. He believes in the Constitution and believes that all of our rights need to be protected from enemies foreign and domestic.   The folks and MSMs, that are out scaring people for $$$, will have their day of reckoning. It's just a matter of time.
Now hopefully he can get his VP and the rest of his party to agree.
Well, what he said was that what he believes is irrelevant as he court has already decided   It's a bit different, but I'm not one to argue over phrasing   MAGA
deal me in!
I love his indifference towards pressuring his personal opinion a true American hero, he respects the law and the highest court of the land! 
"Trump says 17-month-old gay marriage ruling is ‘settled’ law — but 43-year-old abortion ruling isn’t" - r/politics   Typical left: can't just accept their criticism of Trump regarding the LGBTQ community was false, so immediately jump on another issue.
And crying upset SJWs still cry, riot, and talk about "dark ages"... "we need to stand together"...  They are disgusting.
It's refreshing to have a president who honors the court's decision and respects the system the founders put in place.
Trump just strikes me as someone who just doesn't really care who someone is or how they live their life.  He just judges people on their character and how tough they are and hard they work.  People will learn.
CNN: trump is ok with same sex marriage, but wont let muslim men marry 8 year old girls!  is he really the president we need?  find out more at 11!
He doesn't support same-sex marriage. He simply isn't in opposition of it.

I am one of the very few that has been raised by gay parents. And let me tell you, we are not fooled by the media. We are not fooled from the hate they spew. We are not fooled by the corrupt politicians like hillary and obama, who have layed barrier after barrier in front of my mums.   We stand united and together making this country not only great, we are going to make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

I'm a huge lib.  I believe you would call me a chuck?  Or some kind of frog.  I don't get it.  Anyway,  this is good.  Good on The Donald.
I truly wish people actually understood that Trump does not hate gays.
I think people have really overblown some of Trumps comments to make him appear far more homophobic than his actual comments would BUT with that said Trump has still said things which do oppose same sex marriage one of those things literally being "I have been against [same-sex marriage] from the standpoint of the Bible, from the standpoint of my teachings as growing up and going to Sunday school and going to church, and I’ve been opposed to it."  It's definitely great how he's approaching the issue now and **the title isn't lying** however he has also in past opposed gay marriage and other issues similar which is why you will see so many people from those communities 'still' believing he is homophobic.
Leaving my comment for history.
reddit would remove it if this were to make it to the front page.  if im not mistaken, just about all the trump related stuff that did make it to the front page was barraged with "racists!" before being removed.  
 Hey /u/moonlightsugar,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Obama is so pathetic, even in today's press conference he took so many pauses while answering questions almost like he is disabled. 
this is NOT an MSM-approved narrative. Please delete.  -CTR

Don't show them this they won't have a reason to call him a bad guy!!!!!!!   I thoroughly enjoy seeing the hypocritical tendencies of the r/thanksobama board.    
WEW LAD
But but he used to be against it!  Hillary would be better cause she's never flipped on the issue!  (She has)
hopefully he changes his mind just to spite those stupid SJWs
Official Trump Translation:      >"What the fuck does gay marriage have to do with jobs, the economy, tax cuts, border defense, the VA crisis, and our military?  Beat it, you Babs wanna-be."
Wow. What an achievement!!
So, was there ever any backlash against Obama for not supporting it until years into his administration? Seriously, I'd like to know.
Like most that I've seen on this sub this is a non issue. I think my opinion is why is it the government's business? When I ask conservatives I often get "people can act gay to get cheaper taxes", or its a moral issue. My response to the first is why should I pay more taxes because I'm not married or have no children. Our tax system is so screwed up that that actually makes sense to some people. As far as a moral issue I'm not sure I want my government to LEGISLATE morality. Why should any of us have to go before the state and beg for their blessing upon our marriage(granting a licence). 
glorious

I would like to point out that Trump (in 2013) said he believed marriage was between a man and a woman. Obama also said in that interview he was still for equal civil rights for gay couples. Everyone has changed on this topic.
Honestly I don't know How i feel about gay people. On one hand it disgusts me to think of having sex with a man but at the same time I think people should do what they want and love whoever they want.
Yea I have a feeling Obama only did that for re election. 
I was going to say that he is considering placing an openly gay man on his staff, but I didn't like the way it sounded. Ooops...did it anyway. Seriously though, the leftists will say that the employee is a "token", as well as any Blacks or women he hires. They have lost their collective minds.
people on r/redacted are freaking out about Trump and LGBT.  I tried to spea rationally with this guy until he started dropping "dog whistling" about his argument.  Grow up
Trump is doing and saying ALL the right things. Beyond excited to see what a champ of a president he is going to be. 
He could still be fine with it, and think that marriage is between a man and a woman. These seem like two different kinds of statements.   But in any case, good to hear that he said that. 
I love that trump has that stance, but what about any of his supreme Court picks? Aren't those the people who could get rid of gay marriage?
Are there many republicans that support same sex marriage ?
"I'm not somebody who promotes same sex marriage" - Obama  Wew lad. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6K9dS9wl7U
/r/rightwinglgbt
Progressive here. Genuinely happy that he said this. Hope you guys can hold him to it.
Now their argument is that he flip-flopped on the issue. I don't know what to make of this. I think it's really just that he won't overrule it since the courts have decided. Here is something someone said from /r/conspiracy   >"I think the institution of marriage should be between a man and a woman," --Trump, 2000   >"I just don't feel good about it," Trump said. "I don't feel right about it. I'm against it, and I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, for New York it's like, how can you be against gay marriage? But I'm opposed to gay marriage." --Trump, 2011     PLZ dont ban me these are not my words.
The most important thing to me is that Trump will most likely be the first U S. President to support Americans and the America First agenda!  Gay, Straight, white, black, young, old we are all God's children. Gay marriage is so yesteryear. What's done is done. We need to move on to present day issues so we can Make America Great Again.
Looked at the videos, it is correct but not 100%.  Obama did say what was said in this, but he also added he supports UNIONS and NOT MARRIAGE, and how it isn't defined in the Constitution with his definition of marriage.  However, Trump said that it is law and dealt with and will NOT be messed with what is already there. So Trump said he has no intention of messing with gay rights.   Who are the Democrats afraid of again?
Ok, as a bisexual European, I was afraid of Trump winning for American LGBT+ being noped out because of him.  Then, I learned more about Hillary and saw more good things for Trump.  I begin to feel happy that Trump won.

Why are you all being such snowflakes over a Reddit admin??
The original post of Trumps official portrait was near the top of all. All of the sudden within minutes it's score rapidly dropped to 0, while at the same time reaching the top spot on r/all  This meant it was artificially reset (admins) to make it look like it wasn't as popular. At the same time there is already algorithms in place against ONLY our sub to keep it from being on the front page. for example anything stickied can never reach the front page ever, and at the same time it takes up a slot so nothing else can reach the front page while it's up there if we upvote it too much. Oh yeah, our votes are weighted differently too.    Our Sub is responding to that basically, and it seems the algorithm against us stopped working and we filled r/all with the suppressed post lol.
"Well, Trump, forget about it. Looks li- oh, wait, all that fuckery we pulled on r/The_Donald didn't change the fact that Trump is president? Well damn!"

Yeah we know. It's kind of the point.  Occupy reddit
Projecting like the cucks are known for.
I actually am not a Trump supporter [inb4 ban] but I find it fascinating how this sub simply can't find a fuck to give when it comes to Reddit admins losing their shit.
^ This. Don't give them a cent >:)
You are supporting them by every post that you post, every comment you make, and by upvoting every one of these posts and comments. 
I'm about to now. I actually don't like having the all the pro Trump views and opinions filtered from me because I'm not 100% against him and would like to here different opinions, even ones I don't always agree with.   I just get very annoyed with the spam, like I said I understand the shittiness of Reddit and don't agree with how TD is treated, I just don't agree with this tactic, mainly because it's fucking annoying, that's all.
There you go again ,  using  logic  on a special  little  precious snowflake .
So if I find spamming annoying I need a safe space? You guys are doing a great job of driving away people who don't love Trump but still want to give him the benefit of the doubt and here your voices.   I guess if you're not with him you're against him.
If you're going to tout yourself as a bastion of free speech, that applies to speech you don't agree with.    MAGA.
With adblock and a gold embargo, all we do is cost them money. 
what are you doing here?  You're not a trump supporter, go back to politics.
I think that's kind of the point of the tactic, but I can see how it's not appealing to the people in the middle.  As a long time TD supporter, I find it fun!
This is a one time thing because of yet another stunt the admins pulled.
I never considered myself much of a snowflake but I do feel super special. 
Who would have thought?  Ya know with a sub  name like THE DONALD. 
THERE IS A FILTER OPTION USE IT.  Jesus, are you retarded.
Uhh...you're in a specifically pro-Trump subreddit. Not sure what you expected, fam.
make reddit great again
Exactly
Thanks for understanding, I've calmed down and realized it best to not get my panties in a bunch and let you all enjoy it.  
I understand that now, I'm gonna let you guys have fun, like the neighbor who came to tell you to turn your music down and ends up saying fuck it, they're not hurting anyone.
Nah you're good. You let someone explain, actually listened to the why and changed your mind. That's not snowflake mentality.
Yes, I may be. Just learned I was autistic today from T_D so it's quite possible I could be retarded and not even know it.  I'm also a snowflake ;)
I've learned my lesson, I'll try to stay away from now on.
Now we're talking, grab yourself a coat!! Even if you don't agree with Trump, most of us on here enjoy well put together debates that don't involve name calling etc
You are too reasonable for the left, I'm sure I'll be seeing you soon future pede 😉
Wait wait wait are you a rational liberal? ;)  Come back sometime when we're not being jackasses on purpose. You'd probably like us. 
Bye Felicia.

Failure!
Who said I lost anything? I guess you need to make strawman arguments to feel like you win any. Sorry you're butthurt about the fact trump isn't popular, but he's not 60% of this country hate him as they should. You thin skinned cuckservatives are just annoying, stop whining about people actually voicing their opinion if your to big of a nancy to bear somoeone disagreeing with you stop voicing stupid opinions. btw nice evasion of the fact this post tanked in comparison to obamas who had over 17k more votes. But please don't let facts and truth get in the way of your delusion. 
Nice one junior. I think you miss understand the word "cuck" A loser 24 year old pothead who lives with his mother and makes shitty youtube videos isn't really capable of emasculating a real man. You should maybe grow up if you wanna have you opinion valued. 
great response, really the best. good job dude. BTW did you happen to notice Obama's picture got over 17k more upvotes? sorry your salty about being wrong but that happen bro. go smoke a blunt before trumps cabinet makes it illegal across the country again. 
Heres a picture for refernce incase you wonder how popular Drump is verses Obama. http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14332462/photos-crowd-trump-inauguration-vs-obama

#**I've seen things you little pepes wouldn't believe.**  Memes so spicy they burned the most notoriously criminal family-tree in America to the fucking ground.  I watched with tears in my eyes as significantly less than 50% of the US population turned into pillars of salt on November 9th 2016.  I've seen a brakeless train traveling at over seven times the speed of light come to an immediate halt at the gates of the White House.  They will tell you it was beautiful, and you will feel proud. But you will never truly *understand*, little pepes. How it felt to be on the front lines, shitposting in all directions. The line between man and meme blurring until there was no distinction at all.

Gone but not forgotten
F- or real, I fought hard, I was an activist, I poured all my energy into it, and we succeeded. Time to conceal our power levels once again.  Podesta... Clinton... We are coming for you, this isn't over.
**Our losses:**   A couple of anons got banned by cuck moderators of other subreddits and got self inflicted airsoft gun wounds by accident.      **SJW losses:**   Thousands of suicides in a broad variety of methods, millions of them got triggered and got PTSD. Hundreds of racemixed black children were sent to Europe to seek asylums.
I cannot wait for the day that my grandchildren ask me "Did you fight in the Great Meme War Grandpa?"   I will tell them about the great battle for Pennsylvania in which I fought. I will tell them that no matter how many down votes the Shills tried to put on us, we kept our energy high and our Memes dank. And in doing so we were able to put the final nail in the coffin.

Youtube removed countless copies of this video of a bunch of racists beating up a Trump voter and issued strikes to the accounts of those who uploaded it. Posting every day until these racists are identified and punished.
Edit: I have emailed the source video, links to the mirrors, and the longer version of the video to all of the anchors at fox news. I implored them to cover this. The American people need to see this. It is in their court. Please, if you can, take the time to do the same as I.

This is the most important video on the internet right now. PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THIS
If it was four white males beating up a lone black male, it would be all over the media and youtube. But that doesn't fit the Soros narrative for black males to be the violent ones.... and I am certainly not blaming the black community for the actions of a few, but I also don't see an outcry from their community to stop this violence and racial hatred.
Pathethic! And all these people on twitter come out with stories that they are being attacked and harrased by "racist trump supporters" because "Trump legetimized the hate". Yet NO VIDEO EVIDENCE. SEEMS LEGIT! Fascist left both use violence and LIE about others doing it. Projection AS USUAL!
**Hijacking thread to get the word out**  Dickey's Barbecue Pit only allows their franchises to have CNN on, [let's get them to turn it off](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5camhb/turnoffcnn_at_dickeys_barbecue_pit_lets_tell_em/), so people can hear some honest news there.

Why? Why does youtube show all the anti-Trump shit (most of which isn't even true) and then they censor this political violence?   This is such a load of shit. You and I know damn well that if it were the opposite, if it were white men in MAGA hats were beating up a HRC voter, google wouldn't do a goddamn thing about it. The liberal double standards have become unbearable. 
They want us to violently react to this and their protests, what they don't understand is we don't condone violence. We will not strike back with physical alterations.. We will strike back with memes and showing this video every single damn day. KEK will land the blows. 
[removed]
Pedes **YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO**
I like how tons of street fight and gang beating videos are allowed but as soon as one makes Clinton supporters look bad it's gone instantly. This is also the site that encouraged large channels to shill for Hillary so I'm not surprised, stay classy YouTube. 
This is insane 
#*EVERYONE* needs to hear about this.
What in the actual fuck is wrong with these animals?
As someone who voted for Hillary, you as Trump voters should never ever be attacked for exercising your right to vote as you see fit. I for one wish you success in your endeavor to ensure this video receives national attention, as it should, and as it would if it was a Hillary voter being assaulted by Trump voters. Everyone needs to see that video.
  As a former Chicagoan and African American male this deeply saddens me. 11th and Kedzie is full of improvished ignorant people of my race who wouldn'tknow a good thing if it slapped them in the face. Please don't think that we're all like this. I support Trump and despite BLM.    I apologize on behalf of civilized blacks everywhere. 
WHY IS THIS NOT ON FOX NEWS?
I am being unfriended and banned for simply showing the buses of protester videos to people and telling them it's paid for by the Democrats. Ears entirely shut.
CONFIRMED HAPPENED TO ME AS WELL. FUCK YOUTUBE!
What the fuck is wrong with people.. 
Where is the video with the end where THEY DRAG him hanging onto the car???
This more and more **hard proof** that the system is ***still*** working against us. Those idiots never learn.  The left want their revenge.  They lost an unfair fight that was working for them, against us.  YouTube and the NWO media may win this battle of censorship and oppression.  But they've already lost the war.  # 2017. AMERICA IS GREAT AGAIN 
As a democrat who didn't vote for Trump. I am appalled by this video. I don't agree with many of Trump's policies, but I respect democracy and our political system. I hope these assholes get caught and are jailed for assault and/or terrorism. Fuck those guys!!!
I just can't watch these videos anymore. Every time I do this overwhelming feeling of hatred just pours out of me and I can't do anything to quell it. These fucking sorry, pathetic meatbags will probably get away with this even though it's on film and all over the internet. 
$hill here (hoping I don't get banned just cause I voted against you all) but there are only two words I would use to describe these people: thugs and deplorables
Oh don't worry.  FOX News just threw this up on Facebook.  Go share the fuck out of it.  edit: https://www.facebook.com/FoxNews/posts/10154782035936336?pnref=story

This violent racism in black communities hasnt just sprung up, but has been growing and festering over the last 8 years. Its definitely coming to a head now though, everyone be safe.
Obviously this is fucked up, but as somebody who grew up in a shitty area, here's a PSA don't get out of your car for a car wreck until police arrive. Call 911 and stay in the car unless you are extremely ready for anything. In fact if it's a bad area, or night, try to get the tag number and keep driving while on the phone with 911. Just say you don't feel comfortable and you will not get a leaving the scene ticket they can direct you to meet the cop.  This is one of the top ways they carjack people here, bump into the car, then when you get out they take the car. It's a very good way to target particular vehicles and take them directly to the chop shop. They don't car about the damage because they car they are driven is stolen and yours is about to be too.   People pull this shit in the middle of the day in super nice neighborhoods here, it takes like 30 seconds, and don't think it's gonna be somebody that looks like a thug either, a lot of times they have attractive white female drivers in a very nice car just for that reason.
Un-fuckin-believable.  Where Obama's press conference?
I like how they think theyre free of the label of racist because theyre not white.  Black supremacists.
SO NOW BLM is out using Trump as an excuse to continue their Thug agenda.  Not only did they assualt the man they also tried to rob him That thug ass was going through his car while the other Thugs continued beating on him for his political beliefs.  Those shits would never do that with me they will get glocked  and put six feet under.  SHit bags need to be thrown in a dark cell for the rest of their pathetic worthless lives
But that's impossible. It can't be racist. They're black. All the hardships they went through make them entitled to do that to the evil whites

#Never Let Your Guard Down!  Thanks for posting this, and keep it up - Democrats have NO DESIRE to meet in the middle, we need them backed in a corner before they even attempt to listen.
To the top!!! Catch these fuckers
Did they steal his car too..
If you are going to make more than one YouTube accounts. First mirror the video so they cannot just filter it out. Then for the second one you reupload clip it a little bit. For the third account filter it a little. Keep on adding tiny changes like delaying or removeing the audio. Its not 2012 anymore you just cannot reupload the same video forever.  Change the title and tags also. Make Google employees I mean slaves work to find you.  Good Luck!
Perma sticky until it's resolved
Scum.  And guess what?  They arent Trump supporters. Wow! So weird!
They want to act like animals so they should be treated like animals, people like that have no sympathy from me. I don't give a fuck if you're a democrat/republican, black or white..  if you act like that you should be shot. 
Funny how this made-up story with no witnesses - http://www.theadvocate.com/acadiana/news/crime_police/article_2e351106-a74b-11e6-86d9-cf799c2824a8.html?reload3 made national headlines (because the alleged "attackers" were white Trump supporters), but this vicious assault ON VIDEO is vigourously trying to be swept under the rug. The hypocrisy is so glaring yet the liberals continue to deny, deny, deny. Mind blown. 
Has anyone posted this to twitter with the hashtag \#HateCrime? I don't use twitter but I searched and couldn't find it.
Whaaaaa? C'mon.  Everyone knows black people can't be racist. That's racist. 
It cuts out the part where the nice man parks the car for him
Looks like Drudge ran it as well
Sue the heck out of them. Theft assault hate crime. Who is that poor man. HATE crime. C
This is the antithesis of democracy
People trash Trump and Republican voters for being uneducated rednecks living in the countryside. No one trashes uneducated Democrat voters because most of the uneducated ones are blacks or latinos in the inner city and you'd just get branded a racist.
FIND THOSE CUNTS
https://youtu.be/AYkT_xqObgk Just fyi my pedes, this aggression and physical violence toward white people (Asian, Hispanic, old people, young people, autistic people, gay people, women and men too) by large groups of black thugs has been happening for YEARS and the media excuse, deny and lie about it.

I brought this video up to my liberal coworker. She said "I have no sympathy to be quite honest, the trump supporters are doing far worse than the video you are talking about". I asked her what are trump supporters doing on video or is there legit proof of it? She said trump supporters are yanking the scarfs off of Arabian women's heads and putting up graffiti in places. I said "oh, yes they shouldn't do that but there's a huge difference between graffiti and a violent hate crime."   I honestly cannot wrap my head around the logic. Btw, I live in Chicago. Can anyone link me to valid proof of trump supporters beating down Hilary supporters? 
This is what racism and bigotry looks like.  
admins will intervene
Fuck YouTube 
We need to go big. We need to take down Google.
wow this makes me angry. NEED SECOND AMENDMENT!! 
This isn't the first time it's happened either. Protecting narratives is what divides this country.
I'm gonna have to show this to my parents and friends. My mom was disappointed that Trump won but I showed her his acceptance speech and she was so impressed that she shared it with my dad. Neither of them are Trump supporters but they are coming around. My dad is very critical of the protesters and says that Trump deserves our respect and cooperation now that he has been elected. 
Fucking bullies. More examples here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilIX_cz3HIQ  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z86S7lCJ1eI
We need to spread what youtube did, everywhere.  Let the meme war begin.
We got Trump in but there's still work to be done, lads
Want to know why it's being censored? It's still small enough to be stopped if enough attention is drawn to it. It's also too one sided.   They'll start allowing us to see it when the other side starts fighting back and it's already out of control.
Yep, received the [strike](http://i.imgur.com/MNhDt6s.png) also. 
I know this isn't on the topic of this thread but libs are so triggered now that there's a petition to try to get the electoral college to vote hillary, top kek
I've been posting this shit since last night and been ignored. I've even been trying to tell the mods about this... Am I shadow banned? Wtf? Glad it's out there now.    #[This video shows many many people being assaulted!](https://m.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5c8aeq/there_is_a_very_serious_real_problem_being/)
I see all these random acts of violence against people based on their race and political beliefs, and yet the MSM buries the stories since it doesn't fit the agenda and calls us the deplorables...  BLOW THIS UP!
If you noticed, Youtube will usually label videos which show blacks committing crimes against whites as adult content and force you to sign in just to watch it.  I'm so glad most Americans saw through the bias against Trump by social media and the mainstream media.   I really didn't think it would happen, but I underestimated the intelligence of the American People whom I thought was fixated with the lives of The Kardashians.  
email it to podesta and then everyone will see it
Why the fuck isn't this on any news station?
Fuck entitled people. They act like they are owed everything and do little or nothing to work for it.   We need more Ben Carsons and people like her mother. 
fuck. I'm black and I hate this shit. This is NOT okay for anyone, and I hate that it's censored. Thanks for your work here. Animals are animals regardless of skin color

What's funny is if they would have just left us the fuck alone r/all would probably only have 1 photo, but they just couldn't help themselves with a little speech suppression.

Why are they so afraid of this subreddit.  Are the admins and owners so passive aggressive that they won't ban it?  I just want to know.   I hate their fucking guts, but was wondering why.
I posted a pro Trump comment and I got banned.
All of these disappeared from /r/all as of now, at least.  More manipulation?

It's amazing to see all of the anti-trump subs mocking this post, it makes it so obvious that they're still triggered by their loss 
They think it's the work of bots... Lol
What's the story on this? Lol. They change the algorithm again?
This is hilarious. They just never learn do they?!  
Should see what /r/all/rising looks like. When this kicked off there were three pages before I found something from exmormon in the rising section.

You should read into how this sub is actively censored and has special algorithm changes applied to it that no other sub in history has had applied. Reddit allowed r/PedoFriends to go on for a suspicious amount of time while simultaneously censoring us here. We're not allowed to mention r/Polit (you get the picture). Our stickies can't reach r/all. Our users get banned from non political subs by their cancer mods just for supporting the Don. If you care about Free speech then be aware Reddit is moving away from it. 
It's the medicine this horrible site needs.

Naw, this image cannot possibly be improved upon. 
This photo made it to /all with like 8000 upvotes, and within an hour, it dropped down to 0 upvotes, with a 50% upvote ratio, and remained on the #5 spot on all even with zero votes.  Clear vote manipulating by admins.
> why are you spamming this? Wouldn't 2-3 be enough? I am genuinly curious.  Spamming? It's called salt mining.  > Besides that... 19 comments and 11k upvotes? daaamn  We are the 0.1%.
Alot of people don't know but reddit put a "special algorithm" In place that weights posts in the_donald to keep the subreddit off the front page.  it takes something like 6-7 upvotes to count as one upvote to other viewers when you post on the_donald.    The reason for this is do to the fact that dogmatic liberal partisans make up about 98% of reddits admins (and a good chunk of its mods, especially on default subs).   About an hour ago a post that was nothing but a certain picture of trump and the  words "Lets make this picture of our 45th president the most upvoted picture in history". reached /r all.  it had around 3390 upvotes (which means with out the algorithm it had probably closer to 20-30 thousand).  It also had a little over 2200 comments.  It went from that number to a perfect 0 in less than a minute and maintained a perfect 1-1 upvote to downvote ratio for the next hour.  That's not organic, the mods went in and fucked with it manually either by changing the parameters on their algorithm or simply installing a bot that added a downvote everytime someone up voted.  It was the straw that broke the camels back.  what you are seeing is the backlash from a humongous sub which has been dealing with heavy handed censorship by biased partisan hacks for the better part of year.  Most likely as a final fuck you reddit will delete them on inaugration day.  If the admins choose to do this it will in long run kill Reddit since pretty much the entire community is ready to migrate to voat and then spend their internet time to devote the voting power of 300,000 people into make subs like /ronetruegod famous overnight.  Imagine if every day you log on to reddit and every single post on new/all/rising/top is basically months of history from some obscure subreddit nobody cares about.  No news, no aww, no advice animals, no politics just pictures of Nick Cage, or Chuck Norris, or rabbits fucking Parakeets.  It would destroy Reddit usability for casual users.  Today could be considered a warning shot/ultimatium.  Either start treating us fairly or press the button and get this thing started for real.  And really who can blame them, all the mods had to do was allow them to have a picture of the president on the front page for and hour and a half, but noooooo, they had to fuck with them because once again, they are are bitter partisan hacks.  The next 24 hours is going to decide if reddit eventually becomes digg 2.0 or continues on.
>Besides that... 19 comments and 11k upvotes? daaamn  My protocol for this sub is upvote everything. That's pretty much how everyone does things around here. 
To answer your question, the admins artificially lowered the score on the first one. This picture is going to be the most upvoted picture in reddit history. The more it is uploaded the more upvotes the picture gets and it doesn't matter that they are different individual posts. Also everyone loves a good triggering :)
Were mad cause Reddit suppressed a photo, so yeah it's spamming but its for a purpose lol
😘
Lol I would comment. 😂 but I've been banned from that sub for months.  I don't see how those cucks could think spamming all for the emperor is *deep undercover operations*

These posts are about how the original thread's points were set to 0 by admins.
Sad is what it is because its going to take a generation or two to remove the cuck out of our Country. I just hope that the Nation as a whole never forgets how much the left fucked us a Nation, and I really hope that more young people become "woke" to the fact that socialism has never and will never work.
The short of it is, the above photo was posted here and was upvoted bigly. Thus it made it to r/all first page. Then suddenly it went from thousands of upvotes to 0.   Reddit Admin excuse was something along the lines of "muh server slow to update", or some such. They claim there were tons of downvotes when it made to r/all (and I'm sure there were some), but suddenly going to 0 and 50% downvoted doesn't really jive with reality, no matter how slow their server is.  So, of course, the pedes posted a billion posts with the same picture, flooding r/all with multiple copies of it. Winning is glorious.
Yep. Things we sticky don't get to r/all
they still think we can be cucked.

What I can't wrap my head around is why you care so much about downvoting a sub that you hate in it's entirety, really, all you're doing with these comments is solidifying this post at the top, so if you didn't want to see it you shouldn't have given it attention.
Why do you use snowflakes to describe people who don't like trump? I don't understand that. It's been used twice just in this comment thread.

I know everyone here loves our servicemen and women, but I feel like I wanna just say in general that people should treat police, and in particular campus cops, with more respect than what they get right now. Just last night campus police knocked on my door asking about my suitemate, who smokes a ton of pot. Just answering their questions and showing respect to them got them to thank me for not being a prick like most students apparently are.  These people risk their lives to protect us, least we can do it be thankful.

I may not always see eye-to-eye with /r/The_Donald community, but I strongly commend you chaps (as well as The Donald himself) for your unwavering support of the men & women of Law Enforcement.  Hats off to you, Officer!
Wow! 74% upvoted? 26% of users who voted on this REALLY downvoted this JUST BECAUSE it was posted by /r/The_Donald. These people are absolutely sick. This man is a HERO who risked his life saving others. Even their liberal news sources would tell them that.  Edit: Maybe not. They might hide the fact that the terrorist was a Somali refugee and claim that this officer is a xenophobic racist bigot.

The fucking liberals are already complaining that it was a white cop that killed the black guy.  Can't make this shit up.
There are people i know personally saying that the Somalis are the real victims here because of the "backlash" they will face. I cant honestly believe that this is what it has come to. People were almost killed today. Innocent people. And I am supposed to feel sorry for the violent fucks that caused it? Why is good bad and bad good? Why is up down and down up?

If those people think Obama is the greatest president ever they're in sad shape. No wonder they're so ignorant of everything over there 
Jesus Christ. Alright, there is an argument to be made that Obama isn't the worst president, I'll give them that. But the best? Seriously? For WHAT, exactly?  Obama, the Race-Baiter-In-Chief, who has personally set racial relations back 50 years, to say nothing of the drone strikes and foreign policy disasters. Yep, he's totally better than Lincoln and Washington, you know, the presidents that ACTUALLY UNIFIED THE UNITED STATES.

US airstrike killed a family of 8, including 3 children, on October 22nd 2016.  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/mosul-family-killed-us-airstrike-iraq  Go on, ETS, defend this. Tell me how great it is.  >“I could just see part of my nephew’s body under the rubble,” says Saeed
Let's settle this once and for all. Until January 20th, the greatest President without question nor rival is Theodore Roosevelt. Both as a President and as a man he was exemplary.  When Trump is inaugurated he has the chance to tie or even beat Teddy, but he will have to make good on a lot of his promises to get there.   For those of you unfamiliar with Teddy Roosevelt, allow me to give you some highlights.  Prior to being President he was known for commanding the Rough Riders in the war with Spain. Famously he led the charge up San Juan Hill. He charged up a hill into gunfire leading men to fight and die for Freedom.   He initially became a Vice President to McKinley before he died in office. He served from 1901 to 1909 and later ran again in 1912, but more on that later. As President he was a champion of the national park system, establishing five new parks and many wildlife reserves. The other big cause he was known for was Trust Busting.   Back then the wealthy elites ruled with mighty business monopolies called trusts. Roosevelt took a hammer to all that and is largely to thank for the end of monopolies in America.   After his great Presidential career, he groomed William Howard Taft to replace him, but Taft was a big fat loser who regularly got stuck in the tub and tried to solve all of our problems by literally throwing money at them. It was called Dollar Diplomacy and it accomplished less than Barrack Obama did, and thats hard to do.  Disgusted with Taft's performance, Roosevelt ran again in 1912. However now his Republican party was backing its incumbent, Taft, and was not willing to change candidates.   Never one to give up, Roosevelt told them to fuck off and made his own party. The Bull Moose Party. To this day the Bull Moose remains the most successful third party in American history. He robbed Taft of the Lion's share of the Republican vote, but both lost to a racist shitbag globalist.   Anyway, my favorite Teddy story comes from that 1912 campaign. I'll let Wikipedia have the honors since they tell it so well.   >On October 14, 1912, while campaigning in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Roosevelt was shot by a saloonkeeper named John Flammang Schrank. The bullet lodged in his chest after penetrating his steel eyeglass case and passing through a thick (50 pages) single-folded copy of the speech he was carrying in his jacket. Roosevelt, as an experienced hunter and anatomist, correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not reached his lung, and he declined suggestions to go to the hospital immediately. Instead, he delivered his scheduled speech with blood seeping into his shirt. He spoke for 90 minutes. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, "Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot, but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose." Afterwards, probes and an x-ray showed that the bullet had lodged in Roosevelt's chest muscle, but did not penetrate the pleura, and it would be less dangerous to leave it in place. Roosevelt carried the bullet with him for the rest of his life.  To summarize, he got shot before giving a speech, knew from experience that the wound was not severe, announced he'd been shot, then gave a 90 minute speech while bleeding from being shot.  Even General Mattis would think twice about crossing Teddy. Afterall, he's the OG soft spoken, big stick toten, badass President. 
How in the fuck can you possibly believe Obama is the best president ever. Holy fucking shit.
Honestly, you the_donald guys are some of the funniest fucks ever. Thank you. Let's never stop bashing this evil turd.  Actually, obama's way too jacked in this picture.

Barry was the best because he's black and democrat.  thats all that matters to them
54% upvoted and still at +23.1k karma and rising. This DOM is unstoppable. 
I don't think anybody honestly believes Obama is even a great president.  For liberals, he failed to deliver on an astonishing amount of campaign promises, and he didn't bring the racial healing they thought he would (he made it worse, not better).  For conservatives, he was condescending and authoritarian, pushing the legal limits of the president's power to issue executive orders.  His main legacy is a failed healthcare policy and failed foreign policy.  Only completely ignorant shills and racists would put Obama in the same group as Lincoln, Washington, and other presidents that were actually respectable people.
Obama was the highest voted shitpost of all time
 I remember when I was younger my Dad gave me money to pay the electric bill. But I got the smart idea to buy a raffle ticket for a brand new car instead. When I got home, I told my Dad what I did and he beat the crap out of me. But the next day, we woke up to a brand new car in the driveway. We all cried. Especially me, because the car was from the electric company & they were there to cut off the power. My Dad beat the crap out of me again.
I don't see any r/The_Donald posts on r/all anymore. Yet will see a post from a random sub with 18 upvotes... smh.

This is my favorite part of the election. Everybody claims that the previous president was just the best guy in town because they're scared of the new one.

He needs to be holding his nobel peace prize in this photo 
Obamas drone strikes led to (literally) [thousands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_from_US_drone_strikes) of civilian causalities. I'm not even saying its bad (probably it was unavoidable), but imagine if it was Trump. Imagine WaPo fron page. Imagine CNN coverage. Somehow I think it wouldn't be so understanding.

Never forget that Obama droned more countries and more people to death, and supported more countries droning people to death, than all previous presidents combined! 
They've really embodied the elitists that they claimed they weren't. First it was with Iowa's governor being appointed ambassador to China. Now, they'll see any move by Trump to keep peace as something to immediately attack. 
This cartoon is just missing the Nobel Peace Prize around Obama's neck  EDIT: Didn't realize this comment was made already.   But seriously, I don't understand how liberals can't understand why the Middle East hates us and then keep supporting an interventionist foreign policy.

Drone strikes can't melt steel memes.
The problem wasn't the drones as a technology. They are now a permanent part of modern warfare. The problem is the way in which targets were acquired and vetted under the Obama administration. In fact drones had a better civilian safety record than manned airstrikes, but the media demonized drones because they were new and scary. 
The way his legs stick out and the grin on his face is hilarious
>greatest president ever  So I guess fuck Lincoln or Washington then.
So spicy I got a burn
"He came in like a [reaper drone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-9_Reaper)   Those at the peace prize should have have known  That he would bomb the young and old  And he'd make George Bush,  look like a hip-pie  Yeah    Like a hip-pie"
Can I say I fucking loved drones?   No need to capture terrorists.  Turn their shit hole mud huts into ash
The sad fact is that so many on the Left know this to be true and they have to make up these strange mental walls to rationalize it all. I know because I used to be a SJW right before Election Day before I got redpilled.

This feels great
Funny how many of these we can keep up with the hundred of thousands of downvoters :)
you can'ts top this train - it has no brakes
comment for visibility.
GodDAMN I love this man! I am giddy! Dear Pedes, I am probably old enough to be your mom, and sometimes I have to stop and look up the lingo you youngsters use, but dammit I am GIDDY!  I am proud to be a Momma-Pede, and damn proud that Donald J. Trump is our President!

It's not petty, it acutely displayed her entire campaign 
They didn't even have one single U.S. flag during the first day of the DNC until someone fucking pointed that out to them. That's what they think about our flag - a hate symbol.

> Hillary: I'm with her  > Trump: I'm with you, the American people.  Why wear American pin if one is supposed "to be with her", and she is, presumably, with herself only.
H stands for Hezbollah 
She was never running for this country - she was running for *herself*; her pin was actually quite appropriate.
I haven't see the Byrd picture in awhile? 
Gotta rock that branding, I guess.
I think the globalist woman was wearing the flag of the country she was for.
John McCain hates him.

I saw this on all and thought.. the fuck is wrong with this sub? 
This is some high energy shit.
the is some high level energy type shit. 
Sure did. Now it's on all about 5 times on the first page alone. Too funny. 
No, I'm saying that I don't want that to happen. If I really thought that, I wouldn't have even bothered to ask that, let alone browse this subreddit exclusively now.   Believe it or not this subreddit is the real Reddit now. The freedom of speech "level" I encounter here is exactly the same as all of Reddit used to be when I started using Reddit (right after digg got fucked).
I feel like he can get shit done compared to previous presidents, especially with a mandate. 
[deleted]
it was only a question I've been thinking about since I could tell he was gonna win in the primaries. 
I know that I don't want to be banned because I've been literally turned away from the democrats since obama got his second term and I'm finally able to see eye to eye with the red team since Trump (which is dominant in the state of Texas, where I was born.)
Good reply there buddy. You are right, that was a great argument. You have changed my views.  Thanks for the educated debate.
It's not us. It's your lack of logic, reasoning, and a sense of humor.
I'm a digg transplant myself and forgive me but when I first read your comment I assumed concern trolling. So I am sorry. To answer your question, if he fails to deliver we will turn on him just like we would any other politician. But, until I see anything indicating he isn't who we thought, I won't worry about it. 
Yeah I'm getting downvoted too. I just wanted reassurance that everyone won't back down if that were to happen. Its really the only thing on my mind other than that I feel like he needed to win.

[removed]
Yeah, I tried my best to not word it in a condescending way. Its just an honest question that I've been mulling over since trump got popular in the primaries.  It was obvious to me that he was gonna win because of his charisma "level" being way over all of the other politicians/lawyers.
[deleted]
I stopped trolling when I was 10. I can't/don't really blame you though considering all of the psyops going on around Reddit.
Yeah, I saw some of your other comments. You say that a lot. Cleverness over 9000.
And it is valid, but his charisma wasn't the only reason to vote for him, his policies are what sold him. If he doesn't follow through there will be huge backlash. I don't mean he wall either, I mean things like reforming the immigration policy and fixing the trade deficit. 
I honestly feel like Obama just lied through his teeth on all of it. I've heard he was ex-CIA so it wouldn't be very hard for me to imagine.
Nice meme dude!!! xd kys you irrelevant shithead 
>And it is valid, but his charisma wasn't the only reason to vote for him, his policies are what sold him.  Yeah, I apologize, when I said charismatic I was mentally including his policies too, considering the other politicians he was up against had no real policies other than "things stay the same".  I can sorta see now how what I said could come across as trolling only because of the fact that I've seen trolls start their posts out like that and then show their bias in the comments. If only there was some type of tag or something.  
All is good pede. The tag idea is great, I really hope someone implements this!

Took long enough!
PA Centipede, here. My father was a meme mogul. He got in on the ground floor during the original meme boom and made money hand over fist. We wanted for nothing as children. Ours was the house all the neighborhood kids wanted to hang out at, with our yuge swimming poor and all the latest videogame systems.  I know I was my father's favorite. He swore til the day he died that my first word was "Pepe." On my fifth birthday, he gave me my own rare Pepe. I was a little miffed at receiving a gift I couldn't open and play with, but even as a child, I knew it was something special. The Pepe had been created by a schizophrenic nun (the pastor call her possessed) who was burned for witchcraft shortly after the Pepe had been found among her effects. My father, posing as a Vatican exorcist, offered to "take care of the problem" for the church.  Then the memeconomy crashed in 2009. Our president at the time began posting cringeworthy photos of himself drinking beer and doing goofy things like playing with lightsabers. Understandably, Chinese investors got spooked and started dumping meme options, leading to a world recession in memes. We lost everything. Mom left. We had to move into a smaller house. Dad had to sell all the Pepes in his vault just to stay afloat. I did what I could, lying about my age so I could get a part time job at 12. When we hit our lowest, I gave my dad the birthday Pepe from my childhood to sell and put food on the table for one more week.  I was in my first semester of college, working towards an Italian Renaissance Art degree, when my father passed away suddenly. I put my course credits on hold and returned home to deal with the funeral arrangements and be with the last of my family. There was no money, but the inheritance did include one safety deposit box that I never knew my dad kept. It was left solely to me, and I soon discovered why. Inside was my birthday Pepe.  I was struggling financially more than ever, and I had no choice but to sell it. It was a godsend, really, that my father had kept it. I paid off the burial fees, and had enough left over to pay for some tuition. I returned to college, but something inside me had changed. Against the advice of my counselor, I changed my major to Memeconomics. They said the market would never recover, but I couldn't help but follow in my father's footsteps. I spent my summers travelling all across 4chan looking for Pepes to flip, then started shorting memes on reddit. When I graduated, I was still broke, but I had a respectable portfolio of Pepes and a diverse holding of dank memes.  My outlook seemed bleak, but I had a drive and a desire. I made a living, but not without a hard day's work. When Donald Trump announced his bid for presidency, it was like I hit the jackpot. My Pepes were suddenly worth more money than I'd ever seen in my life. But what was even more amazing, is that it wasn't liquidating my Pepes that made me money, it was my know-how of meme markets. Everyone wanted my advice and my time. I was in demand, and when I got tired of making other people rich, I started my own meme investment firm. Today I'm head honcho, and I'm poised to make a very large purchase before this year's election, because I'm going to buy back my birthday Pepe, and I'm going to be richer than I've ever been before.  So rest assured, centipedes. I've had quite the horse in this race. I memed Donald Trump straight into the White House. I will have the largest Pepe empire this world has ever seen. Who knows, with all the wealth and power I accrue during Donald Trump's booming memeconomy, maybe I'll run for president next?

Lord Jesus the fire spreads
I only voted because of this sub. Pa here. 
Holy shit. My mom just came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken tendies and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of tendies out of her hand. Hillary started to have a seizure and a large black man stabbed her with an autoinjector and she started frothing at the mouth. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean for that to happen to Hillary but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is she losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe Trump has the dankest memes. I want to be stronger together. I want Hillary to be president and let in more refugees. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought she was polling well in Pennsylvania???? This is so fucked.

I guess this just exemplifies what I find disturbing about the presidency right now. One of the worst cabinets of all time without an ethics review is being voted in to run our government. People who voted for him probably were hoping he would do a bit better on the cabinet picks. Instead of steering the party towards intellectualism and experience , instead the people who voted for Trump expressing some dismay over the poor choices... getting a picture on Reddit is the top priority of people who voted for him.  Sad

This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a suppressive algorithm to believe in! I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought they were supposed to be suppressed from /r/all?!?!?!? This is so fucked.

they made a photo of trump with thousands of upvotes back straight to 0 for no reason
Artificially set one of our high energy posts to zero points, yet it had a 50% up vote score. Sad! 
##**REEEEEEEEE**
They're brigading, but they can't stop us.
they just ahead and do shit like this: https://np.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/5owf8a/january_19th_2017_rimpeach_trump_tomorrow_is/
I can't upvote this enough.  Then again,  if I did,  I would be a Democrat.

We have high energy.
Not much, Reddit admins are salty so they put this pic that had reached front page (with tens of thousands of upvotes) at 0 [50%upvoted]. It's pretty obvious that they did it on purpose, even if it had received many real downvotes it wouldn't permanently stay at 0.           Basically it's proof that things are reverting back to their natural order, with right wingers leading and making laws and Lefties making jokes about the President on Comedy Central.
Don't forget to upvote comments. Literally everyone is being downvoted 😹
https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ow3nc/the_official_portrait_of_our_president_should_be/  This thread is the reason. Read the comments. When I saw it, it had over 3.5k, climbing /r/all, and the next time I saw it, it had 0.
REEEEEE 
Too bad, he can't MRGA.  Oh,  wait!  /r/the_donald!  HE HAS!
I counted 7 just now. I love you fucking pedes!
Amen
Reddit would be a sub of The_Donald

Never.
Due to Spez, stickies from The_Donald will no longer show up on r/all. ONLY POSTS VOTED ORGANICALLY WILL BE ON R/ALL. We are now RECRUITING for RISING and NEW. Help make Reddit great again!
#[WEW](https://i.sli.mg/Us6liK.png)  #[SUP?](https://i.sli.mg/whgAek.png)
I'm upvoting for free speech. Subreddits must not be singled out for their content. If a ban must occur for verbal abuse, ban the offender, don't punish an entire community. This is a threat to the 1st amendment. 
Rising and Hot are the only things I check on this sub.  I let others filter out the bad from the good in New.
The liberals running this site keep changing the rules because they are losing. They openly discriminate against conservative views. Fuck them.
Hahah I love you guys. I was just in the spez thread reading the original cupcake comments when it first went up and then refreshed it knowing that would change and now there's a bunch of dissenting opinions saying the new censorship method on us is a bad look... And then I refresh all and there's Uncle Pepe 
Honestly, /u/spez I think it's disgusting how a lot of us came here due to the heavily biased sub politics and now that people are interested in the ACTUAL news you come to shill here. Like holy shit, one of your post I genuinely hope was sarcasm "UNBIASED MOD HERE" because if this ain't some shillary pizza gate kid fucking power abusing supporter bullshit then I don't know what else is this. Don't know if you realize this yet, but the more you try to silence the truth the more guilty you're making your pedophillic three election losing candidate look. You would think after losing A THIRD time she'd have better sportsman ship and take that L. 
Upvoting EVERY SINGLE POST!!  High energy organic F U to Spez!
I've lurked around for about 5 years on Reddit, but it's time to do my part. I can't watch this group of people be bullied any longer. I need a coat.
[deleted]
Lol these fucking losers downvoting us to 60% but we still have 7k up votes! 
MAN THE UPVOTE CANNONS!!!
I guess freedom of speech only applies to the left. The second there are different opinions out there, they become "hateful" and "toxic" huh? What a load of crap. Make reddit great again! 
What's really funny is that this thread is only 100 up votes behind /u/spez apology.  I've never followed this thread, but after the spaz had his brain fart. I'm with y'all
This incident inspired me to sub and start upvoting every thread I see here.
I instantly subscribed, and started upvoting all of your beautiful memes when I saw Spez single you guys out after ***he*** pissed all over the idea of data integrity.   He doesnt regret that he did it, he just regrets that he got caught. 
Are any of you seeing that we have no stickies at all?
Post so organic I overpaid for it at whole foods.
Non subscriber to here from /r/all here - can someone loop me in? This seems really discriminatory. I feel like I should do something and I'm not even a big fan of Donald (sorry. I am here to help not hurt)  
Will be upvoting when I see post from here simply because I don't like when people try to bully others. 
ALL COMMENTS WILL BE UPVOTED. ALL OF THEM.  except the ones that need to be deported
I was just thinking how could our energy get any higher from all this winning...  Then Spez loses his shit and..  1. Our energy skyrockets. 2. T_D subs skyrocket. 3. Every gay, black, asian, oriental, transsexual, atheist, christian, trump denier comes to our defense and puts on a coat!  Am I dreaming?
Hey /u/Spez! If you don't want to be called a cuck, don't act like a cuck, you cuck! 
#DID WE JUST GET TO THE TOP OF /R/ALL YET AGAIN??? (YES WE DID)
This is utterly ridiculous. The cancerous users are all on /pol/ anyways. I'm not on reddit half the time but grats Spez you managed to annoy us all. You and your little clique are going down, calling half of america trolls, what's next you going to call them deplorables?  What a sad puppet he is.  
This post is being brigaded like crazy, but this is a war they can't win. Fight on, 'pedes!
I really fucking hate this subreddit but I hate /u/spez even more. I agree with you for once
As they say in Starship Troopers: "I'm doing my part!"
56% upvoted and still #3 on /r/all. KEK  The snowflakes have their work cut out for them!!
I wasn't a Donald voter, but I'll subscribe and help you guys out. Fuck /u/spez.
It looks like they've also made it so if our posts do make it to r/all, they are at least a page or three down from the first page.
[deleted]
Dear fuck /u/spez :       >It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.  How the hell is "organically" upvoting something "antagonistic"?      You make no goddamn sense.
[deleted]
#New is where we are brigaded the hardest. Fight on the front lines! Embrace the cognitive dissonance!
/u/spez needs a safe space 
/r/all is no longer "all"
I dusted off my 4 year account for this sub and this sub only. 
Guys, I stick up for *all* disaffected groups.  I stood up for those wanting to fly the Confederate flag, I stood up for big-game hunting dentists in Africa, I stood up for the rights of LGBTQ to get married, I stood up for gun rights and body rights (yes, including drug use and abortion). Heck I even stood against the sex offender registry back in the day because it would ensnare so many needlessly.  TODAY, I STAND WITH /R/THE_DONALD  I upvoted everything on the first 5 pages and will continue to do so.  Everyone deserves a voice, everyone deserves to be heard.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  
LOL right now this post is directly above spez's statement on /r/all.  Great job, you cuck.  Your suppression of us is working brilliantly.
#3 on /r/all we can do better!
Is this true? Does this apply to all subs or just this dom?   Yet another suppression tool for the most popular, active, and subscribed sub on all of reddit. Makes complete sense. 
So, upvote everything to the top. Got it. 
[deleted]
I promote The_Donald with my Twitter account by messaging  Pepe's who don't know about us bases on their replies on the MSM sites.   I have probably gotten 5 new users in the last few days.  I've even gotten some, already a user replies.  We can build up this community more rapidly without r..all
I've upvoted the top 40 posts on this sub now. I will continue to do so every time I login.  FUCK u/spez. Off to /pol/ we go! Those of us from /pol/ are in total solidaity with you here at r/The_Donald believe me. We will not obey reddit's nu-male CEO.   ##U/SPEZ will be  #BLOWN THE FUCK OUT  #THE  #FUCK  #OUT

I feel like with the other changes (allowing users to block subs from r/all, we'll take over r/all. Sounds counterintuitive, but if people block us out, they won't downvote us. Sure, less people will see it, but for the people who do we'll be much more prevalent.
**UPVOTE EVERY FUCKING POST ON THIS SUB**

I just upvoted 5 pages worth of posts to counteract the anti-Trump script kiddies who are literally botting us with downvotes.  Feelsgoodman  Spez: Upvoted another 10 pages. Every downvote is another page of upvotes. Can't stop this HIGH ENERGY
Why is no one talking about the fact that this subreddit wouldn't of gotten as popular if it wasn't for the deleting and censorship of conservative articles in /r/[REDACTED], even kicking out a Trump supporting mod? Redditors came to this subreddit as an outlet because of the inaction of the admins to address what was going on in /r/[REDACTED].
How about we hashtag # Sticky before the title of any post we make and then we upvotes the shit out of it? They would rage so hard when it shoots up to r/all kek
I don't think this sub NEEDS stickies to reach the front page...It does pretty well just based upon upvotes.

Looking to argue. Whose down?
Her name is Nazi Paikidze and she's the United States Women's Chess Champion. The World Women's Chess Championship just started in Iran, but she won't be attending because she'd have to wear a Hijab, but she doesn't believe in oppression of women. Let's get her to the top and show her some love!
Wait...her name is Nazi? 
Just so you know, her name is pronounced "nah-zhee" and in Georgian, it means "delicate".  It has nothing at all to do with the German kind.

Libs: muhh nazi
OMG, literally a Nazi! Good for her, feminist take note.
CNN headline: Popular Alt-Right Subreddit "The_Donald" Celebrating Nazis
this might be a really stupid question...  but why is there separate men and woman's chess?...

A post in the_donald that I can't disagree with?  I'm....... So confused.
Shes also really cute and talented, I follow chess closely and she announced she wouldn't go a while ago. 
This is what a feminist looks like!
President Donald Trump invites Nazi to White House for 9 dimensional chess match. 
I still want to know why the World Championship is in a country that is so hostile to the rest of the world.    It is a shame she was treated so poorly when she said she was sitting it out.
Telling women what to wear IS oppression. Why is this so hard to understand??
TRUE FEMINIST! 
10/10 would let her checkmate me. Damn she hot
its nice that she is named nazi that way when the left starts calling her a nazi she can say ... thats my name don't wear it out
 Hey /u/EsciSpectre,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
58% upvotes.   Reddit sure does hate women, don't they folks? 
What fucking idiot thought Iran would be a good place to host a women's anything?
Now thats standing up for woman's rights
TIL I support Nazi
And not a single woman marched in the streets for her right to play chess.
Finally a Nazi I support
So the truth comes out... T_D really does support Nazis!
Media tomorrow -  "The Donald supports a Nazi."
She's cute.  I wonder...hold on, phone's ringing.      That was her.  She said no.      Dammit!  Checkmate!  It's like she's thinking many moves ahead...
"The_Donald upvotes muslim hating nazi" i can see it coming already
Turns out the snowflakes were right the whole time, I really am a Nazi supporter. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
CNN: Trump supporters endorse Nazi
Nazí(ნაზი,) it means 'gentle' in Georgian.  the czech translation ain't bad either though.
[deleted]
We love our Nazis, don't we folks?
I think it's pronounced "nah-zee" not "nats-ee" 
Its Georgian name ნაზი  ( gentle )    
Actual feminist where it counts.
Na'zi like the Navi CSGO team, damn fascists ;) 
Why the fuck would they host a world women's anything in Iran?
Remember cases like this when you seen leftist dummies spreading the American Flag hijab image.. the image of an American Flag on a hijab degrades the flag, and the hijab is an instrument of oppression.  Remember we're the only party fighting for the right of women to be free. The Dhimmicrats and their Sharia allies are leading their lemmings over a cliff.
Her name will trigger reddit, to the top!
I told you the_donald loves Nazis !  -The rest of reddit 
Her name is NAZI?! 
was this post removed, i dont see it on the front page?
I did Nazi her name the first time round and had to double read it.
[removed]
>her name is literally nazi  Have we reached meme singularity?
"I will not wear a hijab and support women’s oppression. Even if it means missing one of the most important competitions of my career."  She has more balls than the whole fucking Left.
Usually not a fan of this subreddit, but this post definitely deserves an up vote and needs to be on the front page. It's just crazy how people try to justify the oppression of women just because it's connected to some dumb religious traditions. Good on you r/The_Donald ! 
She definitely deserves to be on top!
Lena Dunham must have mentioned this several times, right?… RIGHT??!
Oppression? Hijabs are a sign of respect! And as long as you respect their men you won't be stoned to death! They're just a misunderstood people.

why is the women's chess championship in Iran?  Was Syria and North Korea booked that weekend or something?
Yes, in order to be the women's chess world champion for this year, you have to wear a hijab.  Just let that sink in for a moment.  
I did Nazi that coming

This is the second post in t_d in two days that I have up voted. Good job. Its surprising that a biased sub is more logical than most other unbiased subs.   She made the right decision by not going. True feminist.

her full name is Nazí Nodarovna Paikidze and she is Georgian-American chess player.
What an odd place to host anything..
wtf why couldn't there be hot women in my active chess time. Only old smoking men and young  male glasses nerds (including me) were playing 20 years ago  
Good for her taking this stand.
[In stark contrast to the "first feminist government in the world" of Sweden](https://twitter.com/HillelNeuer/status/830798952761016320)
First time hearing about her. Good on her not attending, feel twice as proud. Also yea, name doesn't literally pronounce as a nazi :D   also one interesting bit about her last name: paiki (პაიკი in georgian) stands for pawn.
A chess champ. Cool! 
Why do we have to separate man and women's chess championships?
The organizers that put the **WOMEN"S** Chess Championship in **Iran** are the haters. They should be called out big time. 
Who scheduled a chess championship event in Iran?
She's obviously brilliant -- she's a Trump supporter:  https://twitter.com/NaziPaiki/status/822500371071320066
Who would downvote this?
To contrast, the feminist "we want equality for all" Swedish government all wore head scarfs on their visit to Iran without any form of protest or even acknowledging how fucked up that is. Now which one of these is a real feminist? 
CNN BREAKING NEWS: NAZI WON'T ENTER IRAN DUE TO TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. SHE IS TRYING TO ENTER IRAN FOR A CHESS TOURNAMENT AND TO SEE HER FAMILY. SHE WILL BE AWAY FROM HER FAMILY FOR 45 YEARS NOW BECAUSE OF TRUMP.
**BREAKING NEWS**  **Donald Trump Supporters show support for a literally NAZI REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE**
So I am curious, why is this only 62% upvoted. Do we have bots here or does some just downvote everything from t_D

... who happens to have been born in Russia and be an immigrant. 
What if she went and didn't wear one? Would she get lashed or something?
Piss off Islam
Beautiful smart woman who's pro trump but can see the ridiculousness behind both political parties? AND isn't having any of Iran's bullshit? WE HAVE THE BEST WOMEN, DON'T WE FOLKS!?
[deleted]
where the fuck was she when i was in chess club????
No wonder she's a fucking champ, can you imagine the shit she put up with in her childhood? Competition and friction breeds innovation folks, the foundation of our nation. 
we hate Nazis and Facism don't we folks? despite what the left say we dont like Nazis at all. Except this one.
She is beautiful - standing up for herself and not attending that championship:  Truth Courage Wisdom Bravery Respect  5 attributes I strive for, looks like she already has. 
You guys should check her out instagram here: https://www.instagram.com/nazipaiki/   I didn't know chess players could look that good...
Nazi Paikidze? Georgian (not the American one) Name and Surname...Yeah, the name's funny, but the "Z" in Nazi is read like a "Z" in Zebra.
THE BIGGEST FUCK YOU EVER RECORDED IN HUMAN HISTORY!!!!!
I believe I can upvote this. ;)

Your Damn right it is. Feels good to be in the future where we are already feeling a more secure and prosperous world.
Tell me future pede, was the inauguration a success and is President Trump still safe? Did SJWs get BTFO by the many, MANY based supporters?
Was CNN right!!? Were all the illegal immigrants deported to Mexico (despite that most aren't even from Mexico)?   Have all the gays and lesbians been loaded into trains and gassed?   Did Trump repeal the 13th amendment in order to make all the black people slaves again?  Has the economy crashed into depression and the US is now losing a trade war with Chyyyyyna?  Let us know how Jan 20th is going so far, I'm literally shaking
Up to 791 in 52 minutes.  Come on, can we get to 1,000 in under an hour?

New Zealand based comrade here. I tell you, the economy is so strong since Trump became president. It's tremendous. ISIS has already been destroyed by the US-RUS alliance.   It is a time of great peace and prosperity.

Very stoked NZ, wider family are woke and can't wait for The Don to take the reigns.
There was an attempt of Trump's life.   As soon as President Trump came down the stairs, Hillary grabbed her defibbulator and attempted to put the president into cardiac arrest. Based Mad Dog Mattis already had a plan to kill everyone in the room, so moved instantaneously to disarm her. The sudden unplanned movement of Mattis shocked her so much that she malfunctioned, and mouth open like a fish out of water, fell over to her death. Her corpse was grabbed by secret service and thrown in the van like a side of beef.   Pence then travelled back in time to prevent this happening and causing embarrassment to the President on his big day, so unfortunately you will never see it.   EDIT: I did manage to grab some footage of the above events-  Hillary being shocked by Mattis while laughing about what she was about to do NSFW: http://i.spanky.cloud/iA1I7ZB.gif  Her corpse being disposed of like you would with a rotten side of beef: https://i.makeagif.com/media/9-12-2016/n2ahwn.gif

When you tear out a man's tongue, you haven't proved him a liar. You've only told the world you fear what he might say.
For people asking for a statement from mods on the recent announcement, [head moderator OhSnapYouGotServed has posted a statement](https://www.reddit.com/user/OhSnapYouGotServed/)
We don't lobby to silence r/redacted.  Because we don't fear what they have to say.
To liberals from /r/all who came to the comments, can you even recognize fellow liberals anymore? Curtailing of free speech met with thunderous applause?  The internet is a collection of private entities exempt from first amendment protections. It is the single largest and most used forum for expression and discussion, yet you do not have the right to free speech anywhere on it.  So far, most sites have decided it in their best interest not to curtail free speech even though they can. And now here we are: facebook, twitter and reddit are now censoring speech and because it's currently comprised of opinions we do not agree with we are ok with this?  These are not the liberal principles I stand for. What about you?
Seriously. I am not a part of this subreddit but what's happening to you guys is awful.
TRUTH IS TREASON IN AN EMPIRE OF LIES  SPEZ: HI /R/ALL FUCK YOU PEDOCUCK SPEZ  -  ORGANIC CENTIPEDE UPVOTE!  spez2: Friendly reminder that I found this undervalued /r/all quality post in NEW tab - folks - take a few minutes out of your day, every day, to upvote substantive posts that are in their infancy! bring the world our highest performing and most quality shitposts directly to /R/ALL
-------Just Hit r/all, before the bots show up------  This post is 84% upvoted   Total votes: 8532   upvotes: 7167   downvotes: 1365   
Jesus Christ, 6000 upvotes in 2 hours. I love this sub
We have explicit rules in our sidebar. We are a 24/7 Trump party. Same as r/S4P and r/KillaryKlinton. Rules. They do exist. However, when main default subs censor anything that goes against their narrative it will create an echo chamber that is not intended to be so. We are an echo chamber here and we do not hide it. We also do one hell of a job policing out the race baiting trolls and 4chan kids looking to cause trouble. We do not pretend to be something we are not. The verdict was made before we presented a case. Some users lashed out and some just deleted their accounts. Most of us have kept on the path of shitposts, articles highlighting the executive transition, and reminding Sanders supporters there are no refunds. Each time we venture and attempt to engage in civil debate we are shadowbanned, downvoted to oblivion, or outright banned. It is easy to claim victory in a debate when not letting the other side participate.    
This has me pissed beyond belief. If I wasn't on board before, I'm even more on board. They allow pedo sub reddits and extremely racist sub reddits but a simple political sub reddit is somehow a problem. 
I think you guys shit up the frontpage, and i hate your all caps meme spouting. I don't think Trump is suited to be the president of the USA, and I think his attitude towards climate change is disastrous.  That being said, fuck Spez, fuck his pathetic 'apology', and fuck his hypocritical attitude towards this subreddit in particular. I'd rather endure a million shitposts on /r/all than have the entire site turn into one big fucking echochamber.
*The only people who are mad at you for speaking the truth are those people who are living a lie.*
Wow almost all of /rising is the_donald though
Great quote. Straight to the heart of the truth. They fear what we say because it challenges their world view. This isn't about "bullying". It's about seeing challenging ideas plastered all over one of their main pages.  They can't have that. Opposing views are "dangerous".   That's why burning books used to be a thing...
  “If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.”   - [Paul Joseph Goebbels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels) - German politician and Reich Minister of Propaganda of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945.

The country's not going to be great until people understand the necessity of listening to and understanding one's "opposition".   Which is why it's been so encouraging for me- as someone who doesn't have many positive things to say about Trump- to be able to come here and express a contrary perspective without being banned (despite what I've heard) or even downvoted in most cases.  It's been a breath of fresh air compared to some of the other subs I've posted in.

The_Donald has just become christened as a beacon of free speech by what these changes have done.   There are people on all sides of the spectrum who detest blatant censorship such as this. We all have a responsibility to stand with the_Donald. The giants are all moving to silence Trump supporters and this must stop. This is not their place to manipulate what is going on.

The silent majority will no longer be silent. The genie's out of the bottle and Spez is going to wish he hadn't poked the bear.
I pretty much only use Reddit on the official iOS app. When I see a post from this sub I just keep scrolling. Don't need to block any subs and whatever people want to post let them post. But whatever. Keep doing your thing guys don't let anyone silence you. 
Finally something from the sub Reddit I agree with. 
I unsubscribed from all but couple subs and the_donald. I'm not supporting this bullshit. 
Apparently r/enoughtrumpspam subscribers are filtering TD from /all.  Anybody else excited not to be seeing anymore posts from them anymore?

So I'll be honest.  I generally think you guys are trolls and express some awful misguided views but I also think you shouldn't be silenced. That is exactly the opposite of what should happen.   We should have an honest debate about what everyone thinks.  That being said I do appreciate the enthusiasm you all have.  It's something Hilary's supporters never had.

Just joined reddit for the first time hearing this garbage on another site. Can't believe they can just do that....it's sick really.
Lmao, first time commenting here and just received this:   subreddit message via /r/offmychest[M] sent 6 minutes ago You have been banned from participating in /r/offmychest. You can still view and subscribe to /r/offmychest, but you won't be able to post or comment. Note from the moderators: You have been automatically banned for participating in a "safe place for people who hate Muslims". /r/the_donald systemically harasses individuals and communities, including this one. An overwhelming majority of subreddits in this list have already been ""quarantined"" or banned by Reddit. Content and activity you provide to the hatereddit harms this community due to Reddit's algorithms and breaks our rules. We are willing to reverse the ban only if you will completely disengage from these hatereddits. If you will not immediately cooperate with our rules, then do not contact us; we will ignore any other response. If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for /r/offmychest by replying to this message. Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.   Edit: So I responded with "Damn, that's immature" and the response was: You have been temporarily muted from r/offmychest. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/offmychest for 72 hours.  What fucking pussies twice now.
> "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."  I'm not a Trump supporter at all, but I'm not going to stand for what they're doing to you guys. Subscribed and I'm going to upvote every substantive/funny post I see here.  I don't believe for one damn second that they're at all concerned about censoring toxic behavior.

I think all of us should downvote their post, they're downvoting ours.  Fuck cucks and fuck u/spez.

They probably learned that wiki leaks has the emails and want to cover their ass knowing that Massage will release them. Simple as that. This train just broke the speed of light by 33,000 orders of magnitude. 
There is no way Comey would announce this so close to the election unless the information is so damning that HRC will be criminally charged. This is the end for her folks.

Kek, the stock market took a dive on the news.  Rich donors are not pleased.
Holy COW.  I am amazed but not surprised. 2016 is the year of Kek and Chaos.  THIS COULD ACTUALLY FINISH HER.   Its a one-two-three punch right now.  1. Hillary-as-warmonger meme spreading now (weapons-grade persuasion. Any undecided is going to have this fear in the back of their minds)  2. Hillary's investigation re-opened... something might stick this time.  3. Obamacare rate hikes incoming, which will piss off some people with anti-establishment rage.  A five point swing is easy enough right now, just need 3% to move away from her and onto Trump. Let me reframe that. if 1% are motivated by fear or war to switch, another 1% by suspicion with the investigation, and a final 1% by anger over their insurance rate increase... that would do it. ESPECIALLY if the swing states are influenced.  This election is the most ridiculous train ride I've ever been on.

How does this evolve? The FBI couldn't possibly wrap up this investigation before Nov. 8th right? The FBI is supposed to operate independently from the executive branch although we all have our doubts that is actually happening (Loretta Lynch & Bill Clinton's airplane meeting). So why now? Did Obama direct this? Loretta? Is the FBI actually doing their jobs now? Is Comey trying to keep his position in a possible Trump administration? Hillary is a crook and our president and his attorney general protected her, and Comey is on the take, so why did this happen? Is the FBI threatening a revolt under Comey and that forced his hand? Are they trying to get in front of wikileaks? 
400lb hacker's doing?  This is fascinating to watch. The entire Clinton cartel is falling apart right now. 
[deleted]
R/(redacted) is in full meltdown. Tendies everywhere. 
Its impossible the FBI didn't already know about all this. The ONLY reason they would reopen is if they are planning to indict.  Whatever Clinton had on Comey probably is about to get leaked and Comey wants to take her down with him. 
Just on Fox - they will suspend all classified briefings for Clinton.  ----------------- Edit: I misspoke. @SpeakerRyan asking 4 ALL classified briefings to be withheld from #CrookedHillary until investigation is finished.  Sorry, I just got so EXCiTED!!!

I mean fuck I'm Canadian so I don't give a huge shit about US elections but holy shit it's pathetic.   They need 4 dedicated anti-Trump subs (one thats supposed to be unbiased) and then spam anti-Trump shit in non-politically related subs WHILE shitting on the Trump dedicated sub with admin abuse and algorithm manipulation.   Then they meme about dudes being "salty"  when this gets pointed out.  There is only one group assblasted here. If at any point a Trump fan feels bad they can just look at months and months of condescending shit talk and laugh their ass off.   I think we all remember r/the_meltdown.

Thanks for reposting :) Hopefully this one won't get tampered with like mine!
Holy shit. Bill Clinton came into my room to bring me a box of cigars and I literally screamed "BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST INFOWARS.COM" at him and hit the cigars out of his hand. He started getting undressed and humping me and I slammed the door on him. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to Hillary Clinton's husband but I'm literally in shock from his sexual advances. Why the fucking fuck is he trying to rape me? I know what he did with these cigars in the Oral Office. This can't be happening. Why is Joy Behar calling me a tramp?? I'm having a fucking breakdown! I don't want to believe Hillary supports and defends rapists like her husband. I want to remain a "nerd virgin." I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was quietly dying of AIDS. This is so fucked.
DID THIS MAKE r/all AGAIN??? GOD DAMN LADS
They are.     Spoiled little bitches, the lot of them.      Scream some more about tolerance while making things you do not like disappear. You are all shit. You will all die sad and angry, wondering where your trophy for being born is stored.
I don't normally care and usually just try to do my own thing, but the fact that they're going this far to fuck with this sub and suppress this post was enough for me to subscribe and upvoat everything here indiscriminately.  Free speech, my ass. This is this shit Aaron died for.
It's back on top boyz
Anyone else laughing their asses off like I am? I'm having the best time just watching this unfold, and cracking the fuck up!!!

Guys if we keep this up, all the literally shaking Liberals in cali might induce an earthquake which will cause cali to break off the US and get lost at sea. 
I'm really sick and tired of seeing this kind of shit on the front page. It's not creative in any way, and it's just taking up space. This whole election is bullshit. Like... holy shit . My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results of the election. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck did he lose? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I wanted Bernard Sandals to be president and fix this broken country. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was polling well for California???? This is so fucked.

I've never posted on Reddit and only ever lurked on /all and my favorite subreddits. But seeing this completely unsubtle and blatant voting manipulation even AFTER they changed voting algorithms was the last fucking straw for me. Trump winning the election further confirms that we dodged a bullet. Because this election really showcased just how fanatical and hypocritical modern progressives are. Fuck your censorship, I'm now upvoting everything from T_D from this day forth.

Still ridiculous voting numbers but looks like victory is secure.  At 45 min we've got a clean 220k, 116.6k still raising the score while the sore losers finally get up to 103.4k.  At 50 minutes it looks like we won't be dipping back to 0 again, may just update again with a graph of this nonsense. 228.6k total, 121.2k up, 107.4k down  Can't follow it anymore, but the splits at 60 minutes are 248.1k (131.5k|116.6k) and 90 minutes is 268.1k (142.1k|126k)

Liberals who hate America. Even when they are in power the liberals actively worked to destroy the country. I seriously believe that if it was an option liberals would want us to join the EU.

It's refreshing to see him on board with Trump on at least this issue. Hopefully, it'll motivate more democrats to work on Bi-Partisan issues, to actually Make America Great Again.
I dont ask people to agree with me on political beliefs, but I do ask them to be consistent the the application on those beliefs.
Trump did say he agrees with Bernie on one thing and that was Trade. 
Bernie gonna vote trump in 2020 if they run another Hillary type lol
The Liberals at /r/[REDACTED] are even speaking out AGAINST Czar Bernschwitz on this.  They are so brainwashed, they think TPP is a good trade deal and are denying their God to do so.  What world do they live in?
> Delighted to work with him   I'm literally shaking 
[deleted]
[deleted]
Sander's view on TPP, trade and the establishment was the ONLY  reason why I voted for him, that's why it dumbfounds me on how anyone can be so appauled that someone jumped ship from Sanders to Trump. That liberal bubble man.... it fucks with them bad
Bernie-cuck here and occasional visitor to this sub. I don't agree with many of Trump's policy's but if he follows through and destroy the peer reviewed buzzword "free trade" once and for all, and show people that "free trade" in that sense only exists to let corporations use what's basically slave labour to drive their growth on the expense of working families in the consuming part of the world I will give him the credit he deserves for that.   #Let's unite where we can. Our goal is the same it's just the road we chose to get there that differs.
[removed]
The way I see it with Mr. Sanders, he was threatened during the campaign with something so grave that he decided dying mysteriously was not worth it.  That's why he was quick to endorse Clinton, and now it seems he is still toeing the party line.  But part of him wants to support the new president despite his party's fierce opposition to him.  So, he will offer his real opinions from time to time, and then keep his party handlers happy most of the time.  
WTF I hate Bernie now!     -BernieBros     SP@2:  just a joke berniebros
As a Bernie voter thank you based President Trump for having the balls to do on your second day of presidency what us Democrats didn't do in 8 years.
I'm honestly curious what the next-gen BernieSpam subs (Political_Revolution, OurPresident) have to say about this. If they're melting down or having a moment of self-awareness.  Edit: They're not even talking about it, lol
I like Bern. And I like Trump. I hope these two can work together to get something better going. 
[deleted]
Aa-hahahahahahaha!  So much winning!
I feel that a large number of people are simply contrarians that will just take a view because trump has the opposite.  i.e.  Trump: "I have discovered the cure for cancer"  Contrarian: "I love cancer now"
Bernie, while a socialist idiot who doesn't understand history, *does* understand that the current ideological war isn't left vs. right or black vs. white.   It's the elites vs. the working American. It's the war against the middle class.
I still think he's a sell-out and weak, but at least he has enough backbone to stay consistent on several key issues, contrary to some liberal foot soldiers who ranted against the TPP yesterday (when Bernie was still in the race) and defend it today (simply because it's EVIL ORANGE HITLER DRUMPF who kills it).
Bernie said he would support him with shy like this and oppose him when he worked against equality( paraphrasing obviously). I imagine he will supporting Trump a ton, and opposing him barely ever, by this logic. 
Nah. Reddit will focus on Trump and whatever his plans are with planned Parenthood today, they will always find something to bitch about.
[deleted]
That's actually very fair of the cuck. He could have easily been politically cynical and ignored this. 
Whats the issue here?  Its like people dont remember what Reddit was like before CTR put their salary in overdrive.   Both Bernie and Trump were in agreement with TPP needing to go. its a big reason why Bernie supporters, myself included, preferred Trump to Hillary.
He better have a change of underwear, because he's going to shit himself when he sees how much President Trump is going to help American workers. 
First thing I'm upvoting on this sub. I hope that there will be many more of them :)
Suicide watch for those who were pro-bernie and anti-trump? :D 
Sanders supporter here:  Good.  If we expect to make this country a better place for the people who live in it, we need to stop this fuckery of demonizing each other to the point of shutting off all communication.  Let's figure out what things both sides want and work on that stuff together.
Can't we all just enjoy the fact that we're agreeing on something?
Hello, guy from /all here, not a Trump guy myself, however, why is anyone upset about this? Just because it was Trump?
Very smart, and Trump-copy-cat, of Bernie if he wants to win supporters. He could also help heal divisions if he truly wanted to. Killary just encourages division.
If President Trump is serious? IF??  No offense, Bernie.. But Donald Trump wasn't the one who suddenly endorsed Hillary Clinton, aka Hillary "the TPP is the gold standard" Clinton
What are you guys talking about? Most of reddit is agreeing with this move.
[deleted]
Fuckkkkk that. I disagree with Trump on virtually everything but this was a good move. I'm not going to pretend like it wasn't just because it was HIS move. Please don't think that all liberals are that pedantic. 
I swear Bernie's politically bipolar. Yesterday: "We have to resist Trump!" Today: "I want to work with Trump." Tomorrow (I'm assuming): "We have to resist Trump!"  
Great! Now let this be the last time we have to care about whether or not Bernie approves of something Trump did, because idgaf about what he thinks. 
STOP PUSHING THE TRUMP IS A RACIST NARRATIVE THEN, ASSWIPE!
Lol why would a businessman  need the help of an unsuccessful politician to create jobs?
[deleted]
I don't understand - how come on Reddit subs "dedicated" (lol) to "balanced" (lol) political discussion there are 6 articles on the homepage peddling the fake news about Trump's people in the CIA meeting, yet not a single article about the TPP or Bernie Sanders praising Trump?
That's because Sanders actually cares about what is good for our country and the people instead of what is good for the DNC.
Got a better source before I post this across reddit?
He truly is the best President!
Pfffft.Reddit will just turn on him like a rabid dog. They always do.
OK so I did not support Trump during the election and I'm not fond of him now. I of course hope he does what is best for the country because come on, he's our President, how are you going to hope he fails?  Anyway, I reside in the left side of the political world. I am astonished to see how many people I know are outraged by this order. All of a sudden, because it was done by Trump/a republican, it's a terrible thing. I don't get it? It's the same behavior I saw from so many right-winged friends during Obama's presidency.   **TL;DR I'm not fond of the President, but good job Mr. President. Dem friends, stop being dumb.**
Pretty sure this is what his followers wanted anyway... and most of dems... who exactly is on suicide watch?
One thing I notice, I can see how there is so much grid lock in Washington.   Some are claiming that he violated the Constitution and may seek impeachment.  It hasn't even been one full day yet.  Good grief.     So when the Dems win the presidency, Republicans are going to fight back with a bunch of nonsense.
Reddit hates the TPP.  But it's fair to give credit to Trump where credit is due, even though I didn't vote for him. TPP is awful for business and technology. Corporate power grab. 
I don't like Trump, but this is one thing I'm glad he's done and I hope to see more of in the future.
I fucking told everyone, Bernie or trump. That's what it was. Fuck Hilary. And today I post this comment proud as fuck. Trumps been burned today. In a good way!
Quit with the race-baiting and identity politics Bern and maybe we can get stuff done.  The only identity which matters is American citizen.  
it's a good thing the DNC sabotaged his campaign, or the election would have been a lot closer than it was.  democrats need to understand that trump isnt the enemy: it's the people in their party who undermined guys like sanders, to prop up a corporate puppet like hillary.  as you can see, there is common ground.  trump is not cruz or rubio, he is not the traditional establishment republican.  and obviously, he wants the country to do well economically.  isnt that something we can all agree on?  meanwhile, hillary wanted to sell americans out to china.
CNN: Trump destroys the TPP in a fascist gambit against free trade (also, Russians)
I'm a Sanders supporter, but I'm not on suicide watch like how the other "Democrats" and the rest of the liberals are acting up  right now. I'm glad the president upheld this promise and he delivered! 
Rip reddit
I will laugh sooo fucking hard if Trump does pro-worker (progressive) things, puts in a National Health Care System and other hyper progressive shit.  He's the ultimate troll, getting both Democrats and Republicans to hate him.
Ya'll realize he was always against TPP?  This post makes literally no sense.
BEND THE KNEE BERNIE!
Would be a shame if R/all were to see this and have a panic attack in their safe space. 
Fuck Bernie, he blamed Trump for the lefts identity politics, sold out during the race, and now he's crawling back to the winner.
For all the faults of your candidate in my opinion, this is one of the things he ran on that i strongly support. As a Democrat and Bernie supporter i applaud this decision made by Trump. 
But but muh narrative! 
Wait what? If I go on /r/all right now everyone is saying that this is a good thing. Who's on suicide watch exactly? This just seems like you guys are trying to reinforce your preconceived ideas of people. 
Well thank you very much, good to see a bit of consistency on trade at least.
its ok to get along and agree with the other side. not everything your politician does is the greatest or only way it needs to be done.
Forever libtard here. I've been relentless in defending Trump of late because he is my president. He also is not racist or any other smear they try to throw at him.  That being said I'm glad Bernie is sticking to his guns and backing Trump on these trade deals. I hope that maybe we can rally other progressives to work with Trump on policies that make sense. A bi-partisan Congress and Senate is what we need and I feel as if Bernie is ready to lead the charge.
"President Trump" ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ still can't get over it
LOVIN' IT
I was in Rochester NY during the Primaries and saw both Trump and Bernie speak to thousands.  What struck me most was how much they had in common!  Both said they'd tear up TPP.  I'm pleased to see Bernie actually making a statement supporting it.
I'm not a Trump supporter, most of his political views didn't align with mine. But this is what I wanted to see when he won. I want him to succeed for all our sakes and prove me wrong. This was a good move on his part and I hope he takes Bernie's offer. 
Bernie is the guy who sits next to you in public spaces and tries to become your family - he's always saying "work with you", what he means is "try to weasel my way into the story, then leverage my press association for favors / gifts"
Now THAT SHIT I'll match! 
To blindly follow Bernie and be upset by this is a load of shit. TPP has always been garbage and trumps stance on it certainly made the decision all the easier.
Actually Reddit are being grown up with this one
Only a hateful person would take something good Trump does and turn it into something bad.   Looking at you MSM, liberal celebrities, and pretty much most of Reddit.
Any Bernie bros here? Please take a COAT
Reddit seems to be fairly happy about this?
Trump seems to be what people thought Bernie was all about and why they really liked him.
This. This right here is why I voted for Bernie and then Trump. 
Everyone should be on board with this. Sky is blue. TPP is bad. Simple.
Even though socialists are nothing more than a bunch of damn commies with no balls and no guns....  I can appreciate the principled among them...
LOOKS LIKE SANDERS IS OFF THE SOROS PAYROLL. TIME TO GET REAL!!!
Tulsi and Bernie were the only ones on the opposition side treating Trump as the incoming president after he was elected.  Bernie disagreed with him and said a lot of "if PE Trump does _____ I will fight him!" but he treated him like an incoming prez with whom he disagreed.  The others were still screaming "BLOODY PUTIN" into the mirror three times and hoping it would make Trump magically disappear.  There's a big difference between Bernie saying "I will hold you accountable to campaign promises" and DNC fuckheads saying "YOU CONSPIRED WITH RUSSIA FOR FAKE VOTES!"  And once you wrap your head around the fact that opponents of the Clintons literally get murdered, it's impossible to be too hard on Bernie for endorsing her at the end.  At least when he did endorse her he did it with absolutely no energy or conviction.  If it was Bernie vs Trump in the election I still think Trump wins it... but I think that Bernie would have done a hell of a lot more to unify the country afterwards than Hillary has done.
"Delighted to work with him."  Those words make me so God damn happy. I love the "bend the knee" meme here, but realistically, this is what I want. I don't want political homogeneity, I want opposition to Trump. I want realistic, adult conversations from multiple viewpoints, and I want an honest consensus to be reached. That's why we give these people power, to say things that are uncomfortable, and to address issues that are uncomfortable, and to resolve them.   I think the rest of Congress will do well to follow Crazy Uncle Bernie's lead here. 
Is there a source for this? I tried finding a link to send to my Bernie Bro Brother but the quote I found was slightly different.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-statement-on-trans-pacific-partnership
Libtard here; can't agree with all of his points. You'll never 100% agree with the guy you voted for.
WHAT A NORMAL LIBERAL WHO IS WILLING TO COMPROMISE FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE PEOPLE!?!?!  
Trump is going to win in a bigger landslide in 4 years and Bernie knows it.  The media can't hide his message anymore. Bernie wants to be able to say "I worked across the isle with President Trump to ensure that American jobs were brought back home to you, my voters" when the 2018 midterms come around, or he's going to get crushed by the hordes of new centipedes at the polls. Conveniently, his position lines up perfectly. And that's fine, we can use ol' Bernies vote. But he better play ball on other shit, too, or Trump can put him on blast and get him ousted.
Bernie is cucked and confused so much that he doesn't know whether to shit or wind his watch. Just the other day he reverted back to identity politics to fight Trump. Bernie is a fucking joke but at least I can delight in libtard tears.
Honestly, Sanders just kisses the ass of whoever is in power. I have 0 respect for him no matter what. Nice to see the rest of his somehow still existent supporters turn on him

I saw a video of a progressive crying over this, an "adult" woman. She wasn't just *crying* it was like a shriek. These are supposed to be adults, what the hell is wrong with them? It's disturbing.
It's things like this that give me hope that Trump is going to be an _amazing_ president. Sure, he's going to make big mistakes and I'm still nervous about him but he's off to a pretty solid start. This is objectively a good thing for the American worker. It's completely in line with his stated goal of 'America First'. Good job, Mr. Trump. 
Why the fuck is this being downvoted. REDDIT!!! YOUR SAVIOR IS PRAISING TRUMP GET FUCKING USE TO IT
Senator Sanders has always been against the TPP.  He doesn't care about party line crap.  He speaks when he agrees and he speaks when he disagrees.  Everybody should be against the TPP.
President of the United States of America tomorrow! Let's make this the number one post in the history of reddit.
They artificially put it at 0         Oh well guess you got us...oh wait, Trump is still president.

I have to say I love just how much reddit bitched and moaned about how this sub was ruining reddit, then they were given a perfectly simple solution to block us and didn't take it. Why? Because they need this sub. If they didn't have this sub to be the target of their hate and vitriol, well then they might have enough time on their hands to realize just how empty and meaningless their lives are. 
So glad our President-Elect made giving a thumbs up cool again.

Just think of this. If everyone starts doing this and making this exact post until they finally stop fucking with the algorithms, he really will be the most upvoted president in history.

I even hate the Progressive part because no one asks what they are progressing towards. (It's fascism)  You know what else is STRONGER TOGETHER?   A bundle of sticks.   Etymology: The Italian term fascismo is derived from fascio meaning a bundle of rods, ultimately from the Latin word fasces.[14] This was the name given to political organizations in Italy known as fasci, groups similar to guilds or syndicates and at first applied mainly to organisations on the political Left.

Nancy Sinatra stumps CNN. Says it's not true she's upset Mr. Trump is using her fathers song. Why do you lie CNN?
Ahhhahahahaaa!  Asking CNN why it lies is like asking water why it's wet.
Sucks tho, cause most people don't see her response. This fake news bullshit is out of control. They blatantly lie to construct a false narrative, and somehow never have to be accountable for the shit they say. CNN has fallen to despicable lows over the past 14 months. Never thought I would see the day where TMZ and Breitbart would be better and more credible journalism outlets than CNN. 
It's called "fan service" and CNN knows its audience.
Because CNN is FAKE NEWS

Have we forgotten who Frank Sinatra was or what he was about? Frank would've been a massive Trump supporter and wouldn't have been afraid to say it, I have no doubt about it.
According to CNN every performer has to "defend" their decision to perform at the inauguration.
my favorite is Zucker actually saying Trump shouldnt fight with them because they have a global reach and influence.  He *literally* claimed to have supreme control over worldwide thought, and be untouchable, in fact even above the Administration of the US.  Absolutely nauseating - CNN needs to be shut down immediately.

CNN has shot themselves in the foot so many times that they don't have a leg to stand on.
Guess what? The media is still running the fake story and ignoring her tweet. 
Because they're leftist propaganda masquerading as news
This is why I like this sub...I think you guys are idiots, and I'm not a Trump supporter but fuck if this is the only way I'm going to come across information like this.  You are the only source of non anti Trump stuff I can get without having to read crap like Breitbart which I don't want to do.   Keep up the good fight...and fuck CNN ... more fake news.  I wish Trump's staff would compile a list of all this kind of shit, and all the times CNN has been caught lying and then just beg them to ask him about calling CNN fake news.
Also they took that top line from someone who tweeted that ON her page and assigned it to Nancy Sinatra. Good on her for being honest, even if she doesn't support President Trump.
Holy shit, talk about passive-aggressive:  > Sinatra tweeted a link to this article, saying: "That's not true. I never said that. Why do you lie, CNN?"  > Sinatra deleted her tweet regarding the song after CNN published this article.  They wrote a fucking article about a deleted tweet that referenced a meaningless line of the song (*"And now, the end is near."*). What is that line supposed to mean? No one could possibly know except Nancy Sinatra herself, and she's calling them out for lying. Shouldn't that tell them something about their interpretation of her tweet?  For fuck's sake, CNN is so far up their own ass that they're literally **dictating someone's opinion to them**.  **Nancy Sinatra:** I'm not unhappy about it.   **CNN:** Shut up, you're unhappy about it.
God CNN is such a whore.

So, at what point is stuff like this "stretching a quote" and when is it defamation?   Say Nancy Sinatra is actually good friends and well known in a conservative circle of 'publicans -- does this amount to some kind of defamation or slander against her? Probably not, but it still seems like it shouldn't be legal to quote someone on something when it's absolutely 0% true.

CNN is FAKE NEWS.. 
CNN is a sociopath network. They have no shame or conscience. They willingly aim to destroy our nation. When they get caught, they shamelessly lie and make up ridiculous excuses, and waste no time shaming themselves again. And they act self-righteously the whole time. They are morally bereft.
It's absolutely hilarious how much credibility CNN has lost
CEO of Reddit just called us 'toxic users' and a 'poorly behaving community', threatened an 'outright ban', imposed more discrimination against our posts reaching /r/all BUT still allow pedophiles a safe space to share their demonic fantasies with each other

The maturity level of the CEO of this board is not adequate clearly lol.
[deleted]
bigotry - intolerance of others' beliefs.  u/spez is a bigot.
He allows Pedos, cannibals, commies, ISIS, and all sorts of nasty people on his site.      But he disagrees with us so he will try to ban us.     Cock sucker.
He was asked why he doesn't implement the "no stickies can reach /r/all" rule for everyone, because many other subreddits do exactly the same thing, and he said it was because everyone else uses it for good purposes. So /u/spez is outright saying that it's not the behavior that's bad, but rather that he disagrees with our viewpoints. &nbsp;  EDIT: Here is his comment for anybody interested - https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/damg9kn/?context=3
Sooooo we're toxic because we support the President elect...?
LMFAO REDDIT HAS TURNED INTO A FUCKING SHITHOLE

human garbage, fuck /u/spez fuck you reddit.
>I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned.  What a sincere apology.  They just don't get it.

/r/pedofriends  i'm not kidding, Pedophile /u/spez is ok with subreddit existing 
[deleted]
If he's against freedom of speech that "offends" him, he should leave this country. Fuck you spez.
At least this pathetic cuck is showing himself for who he truly is.  Free speech means nothing to these people.
My favorite part about r/politics, and other political subs, is when they put a 10 minute time limit on you in between responses while you're being bombarded with lefty shills whose arguments are the equivalent of a toddler throwing ravioli at the wall.  And they have the nerve to bitch at us about being banned from this sub for cuckposting.
/r/the_donald is literally the most positive and welcoming community I have ever been a part of on the internet. 
[deleted]
Look at all the leftists defending a CEO for violating his integrity. Had this been a conservative or republican mod, they'd be screaming but since he's on their side it's okay. 
[deleted]
I'm didn't know about T_D since recently because I'm quite new around here. But shit I've been following the recent news about all this mess /u/spez did and I had to come here and say that what this CEO did looks like a joke. I can't belive the CEO of such a major website can do something like this and walk free saying that some people were aware of his attempt to "troll the trolls".
#WATCH: WE MAKE CEO OF REDDIT BEND THE KNEE
The_Donald will adapt and overcome as it always does
What is wrong with this guy. 
Another thing, why is the main politics sub allowed to be a festering liberal circlejerk and when it is SUPPOSED to be a balanced view of both liberal and conservative opinions! If you want pro-Hillary content, that's what the Hillary subreddit is for! For pro-Trump content, that's what the Trump Domreddit is for! The fools on the front page cannot be fucking serious about complaining about the Donald being a safe space for trump supporters, when it is the most popular pro-trump platform on the site. That's like complaining about the Hillary subreddit for being a safe space for Hillary supporters. BUT OH It's ok to complain about us though, because we have a different opinion than the liberal reddit hivemind, give me a break!

Bullshit.    /r/The_Donald get's called 'toxic' yet subreddits like sexwithdogs and zoophilia aren't threatened with being banned? Blackpeople twitter regularly promotes racism.     If you want to 'crackdown' on 'toxic' users, how about do that to the entire extent of reddit and not just because your political beliefs are different.
Just because we are conservative, we must be "toxic users". The tolerant left are only tolerant of views that are the same of their own. FUCK /u/spez
Liberals go crazy when trump "threatens" free speech with flag burning consequences but a day later celebrate when the Donald's free speech is censored.  Anyone else see the irony here?
So in his own words, the CEO just called us a basket of deplorables.....deja vu. 
One last thing in regards to the whole pedophile thing. If you ban a subreddit dedicated to investigating a pedophile ring, but keep certain pedophile friendly subs, DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU GET CALLED A PEDOPHILE FOR IT u/spez! I've been seeing an alarming amount of reddit users defending pedophiles (Even before I was on The_Donald!), by saying "Oh but they haven't molested any children they just got screwed by genetics!" Man I don't give a fuck, they are still pedophiles and they are still a threat to my kids and I want them as far away from them or any other kid as possible! It's very fucking disturbing as it almost seems like they are trying to plant the idea of pedophilia being ok, which given the current degeneracy I have see from certain liberals, I would not be surprised if society would have gotten to that point if Trump had not been elected president!

Mfw my username is always relevant and topical 😭
Donald Trump should buy 51% of Reddit stock just to fire u/spez
Where is this safe space for pedophiles?  It'd be a shame if it were a trending subreddit, nom saiyan?
"I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned."  This is the biggest lie I've seen on Reddit since the last HRC quote I read.  What a LOSER!
I wasn't toxic until over half of America decided I was for no reason other than they didn't like who I voted for.      Fine.  I'll play your silly little game then.      You have *yet* to see true toxicity.  But you will.  In spades.      Elections have consequences.  Unintended consequences.
What pedo safe space? Is this a sub?
The battle's over. the_donald won.   Understand, that if nothing else, that publicity, no matter how distorted, is a boon. Also understand that most of your recent joiners didn't know shit about Reddit (like me). Now if I was today still unaware of the_donald this Reuters piece on Drudge would have put me on it in a nanosecond.  https://www.yahoo.com/news/reddit-launches-crackdown-abuse-ceo-targeted-185507683--finance.html  Bottom line: the_donald is bigger than Redditt. It's its own brand and can pretty much tell anybody to fuck off. In fact, I don't think its even a good idea to interact or respond to whatever other Reddit think or say about it or their plans for squelching it.  Reuters is absolutely pathetic. They should be more worried about their home country's brexit and the EU disintegrating rather than a bunch of people shitposting on a sub reddit.  
Post is being brigaded, just refreshed page and all comments lost at least 3 points. 7:14 Eastern time
Conservatism is the new Counter Culture, I swear! 
Correct The Record should be illegal. It promotes 1984 level censorship.
What a motherfucker u/spez is a bitch
how does someone in charge of a huge website fuck up this bad and still have a job ? Seriously messed up the guy in charge isnt asked to quit immediately.
I mean, there are really some disturbing subreddits where people talk about pedophilia, murder, rape fantasies, torture, etc. But I guess all those subreddits are okay and one supporting Donald Trump is not.
His shitty attempts to trivialize and downplay his actions are disgusting. "Its fixed now"- /u/spez . You're still here douchebag so no, its not fixed. 
Upvote every post from now on boys really fuck with them!
#i would normally call for a sticky, but lets get this to the top anyways!!!!
Didn't he mod a subreddit about cannibalism?
[deleted]
Yep, pedophilia and SRS which actively doxx people are totally fine.
This guy must step down.
ok fuck it. whats an alternate reddit? i bet we could get 50,000 subscribers to a different sub in a different site if we really pushed it.
If we are able to get so many posts to the front page, isn't it obvious that a majority of users are all right with it? It does take a large amount of support to reach the front. 
 u/spez - Sad liberal tears are the best kind. 
So....we all get punished for a few who MAY have harassed or bullied someone on another sub?  Kinda like the Trump supporters were all grouped into one big basket of deplorables? People need to pull their big boy britches up and get over it. Someone calls you a name  or bullies you, bully them back.  Or get over it. This is the internet are they really scared of someone they cannot see?
Goes to show just how little he thinks of the people on this sub. Damn. 
If I was writing a fiction novel about someone who was CEO of a major tech company that acted as /u/spez has the last week, I couldn't in my wildest imaginations have exceeded the reality of what /u/spez has actually done. This guy is a CUCK on the galactic scale. His written "apology" comes across as so disingenuous that it's pathetic. 
"Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all."   That's the shit I'm talking about. You want to implement censorship? Don't be a coward and apply this to EVERY subreddit, not just us. And what about ETS? They consistently reach /r/all too, they get nothing?  I'm about to peace the fuck on out of here boys, this is literally the downfall of Reddit that people have been speculating since it's popularity, this is what kills this site. This bullshit right here, and I'm not even mad, believe me. I'm having a ball watching it slowly suffocate. We will regroup at another location, T_D I mean, this I know, so I'm not even worried about losing contact with you all if this shit goes under, there's NO BRAKES on this train. 
Fuck /u/spez.
Annnnd this is how you spread T_D throughout reddit. lol!
In all seriousness, /u/spez and visitors, I beg of you:  #PLEASE STOP, I'M SOOOOOO TIRED OF WINNING!!!!!!!!
Meanwhile SRS, with their automatic ban bot that silences free speech, with their ability to directly link to other subreddits and brigade, with their ability to harass other users...  **STILL ISN'T BANNED**  I notice when they start touting off about how they hate a sub, that sub gets banned.  Making your priorities real fucking obvious you cuckshill admins.  Obligatory #fuck /u/Spez  No brakes for free speech you fuck. Don't feed one side of the fence if you're gonna shittalk the other on full blast. 
Oh boy, /u/spez is fucking with the mechanic again. "Points"is gone.
[deleted]
I had a guy on r/politics threaten to "set shit off and blow my head off" yesterday because I offered him to come in out of the cold and have a coat. There are a lot of psychotic losers on Reddit but I never encounter them in r/The_Donald Fuck u/spez 
Remember pedes! **It could be worse!**  ***Hillary Clinton could be president-elect!***
fuck /u/spez
Spez and his asslickers can suck my wiener.
Lefty here. I don't agree with y'alls politics, but I'm on y'alls side this time because I support free speech. /spez fucked up big time with the edit and even his "apology" shits on y'all. Saying y'all are "toxic users", there's toxic users in every sub. Really seems more like political prejudice than anything else. ~~in good news, did y'all see there may be a title editing tool put in place?~~
I'm not a Donald trump supporter by any means, and I wasn't a Hilary supporter either, but Jesus Christ the amount of bias he shows towards them compared to this community is astounding. Also, I love the shit posting that comes from here, it's hilarious, he needs to lighten up.  And anyways, Trump won the election, try to recount all you want, you push forward a corrupt, shitty, genuinely morally bankrupt person and you're surprised that they lost? You let them basically censor Reddit and manipulate votes, and she still fucking lost, get over it.
lol the only thing "toxic" about Reddit is the rest of the users who aren't regulars here. WE aren't the problem with Reddit. Spez, Reddit itself and their communities of hard-leftists ARE
What I love about his statement is he saying we all need to and come together as a community , while just shittin on us. Does he even realize what he's saying is fuckin retarded
U/spez is a spineless cunt. He turned 10 years of reddit into a shit ticket and wiped his ass with it. *Fuck* you, douche bag.
Me thinks /u/spez and a lot of other liberals forgot that the fight for the next election started already and this is yet another laughably great way to lose votes next time around.  edit: posted this in another thread by accident but I intended for it to be here so i'm double-postin like a rebel.
I hate you The_Donald. But I would never silence you.
So let me get this straight.  He comes in here, a sub he hates, and harasses us. And his apology is he bans us from all?  
How the fuck are you going to "heal this country" when you are threatening to ban an entire community just because they disagree with you. I didn't vote for Trump but goddammit am I on y'alls side on this one. If a community is manipulating votes and/or using bots to spam all of Reddit then I get finding ways to put a stop to that and making them play by the same rules as everyone else (not saying you guys are manipulating votes). But to threaten to ban an entire community purely because you don't like them is 100% censorship and utter bullshit. I'm all for everyone playing by the rules but it appears the Reddit admins want to apply their own set of rules and impose them onto everyone else. Fuck that. I didn't vote for Trump but I frequent your community daily so I can hear the other side of the argument and find common ground with you. That's what we all should be doing. Not banning our opposition and imposing our own beliefs on everyone else. Sad day for Reddit. 
I used to hate this subreddit and Trump but shit like this really made me think of y'all in a far better light. MAGA.
This nonsense prompted me to finally stop lurking and create an account on Reddit. The more they try to censor, the more people will join. I'll be here in the trenches upvoting with the rest of you deplorables from now on. Fuck u/spez and fuck all the butthurt cucks whining about their fee fees. Long live r/The_Donald!
[deleted]
We need to get an image spread of Reddit's owner company, and all their subsidiaries.  #VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET  #VOTE OUT CUCK /U/SPEZ
I don't agree with most of this subreddit at all I mostly loath it but the CEO talking about banning out taking the_donald off  /all is pretty fucked. How spineless can you get? 
Lol
Long term we need to GTFO out of this place and have our own site
/u/spez has not read 1984 (he has, it's his instruction manual)
[deleted]
A poorly behaving community? I knew I should have capture the list of submissions to /r/the_donald on election day ... it would be wonderfully interesting to do a side-by-side comparison of /u/spez 's comments and a montage of the "I voted" enthusiastic selfies that were shared here of from people of all races, ages, and genders.
We need new apps for us
Just want to say I'm here because I followed a link on /u/spez's post.  I'm glad he brought the community to my attention whilst making himself sound stupid.  Have room for one more non-lib?
This is some hypocritical bullshit right here.  Entire subs are devoted to watching people die, people displaying nasty underwear and popping pimples, but a fucking cartoon frog is "toxic"?  Fuck me running, this is exactly the reason this sub has enough subscribers to fill the Superdome 6 times over.  It's the only place in the entire Reddit-verse we can celebrate our Candidate winning!  
Look at me /u/spez -  We Reddit Now. -  We make it to r/All the same way subreddits like r/Aww and r/Pics does. We have the numbers and the enthusiastic support that allows for it.
Why is everyone involved at a high level in tech an insufferable faggot?  Is Digg still open?
Weird, I only started coming here because it was the only place to have open discussion without being called racist because I'm white. I guess in their eyes, hearing both sides of an argument = toxic.
[Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/QLCqLo6.png)  I hope you like it
I love how they comment on the behavior of users HERE when I constantly get nasty PMs when I rarely leave this sub.   More projection from liberals. How typical.

/r/spez called us toxic but not blackpeopletwitter that promotes racism towards whites. 
/u/spez using his OWN fuckup to censor /r/the_donald
/u/spez is like the government in that each mistake is used as an opportunity to make an even greater mistake.
Yep.  That's what I'm doing now, too.  Hopefully there are as many of us as I think there are and we can counteract this BS and hit /r/all even harder than before.  But, the cynic in me has doubts.  Looking at /r/all right now, you have to go down pretty far to see ANY posts from here.  So I have a feeling that they've just dialed up the 'algorithm' and used the sticky thing as a cover for it.  (Now people will say "wow, they must really abuse that sticky thing, I don't even need to block them anymore")  When, in reality, I never saw more than one or two posts that had been stickied at the top of /r/all - and those were usually big posts in their own right (getting 7k points despite a 50% downvoted level)..  Also, they need to do something about the brigades if they are going to keep this up.  If a user does nothing here but downvote, then Reddit should run a simple script to block this subreddit for that user.  I mean, there's no reason for people to do that anymore, right?  And surely that's not what the downvote button was meant for?
Reddit is rapidly going the way of Digg if they keep this mentality up.
[deleted]
Did the same shit after orlando
THIS IS JUST BEYOND DISGUSTING.
I hope people understand this goes deeper than just censorship. Without stickies the admins (or bots) have more power to set the narrative of the_Don by determining what gets upvoted more easily. This will be used to change the prevailing views and instill division. 
2D Chess if I ever saw it. He has no chance. Sad!

What would happen to the ad revenue if the_donald crew took a day off? 
Spez, you just dug the hole you are standing in even deeper.  What a shit show.
This made me subscribe.  I'm not a fan of all of this sub's content but it's not up to reddit admins to decide that I shouldn't be seeing it.  
Fuck u/spez

testing
/u/spez just trying to hide the evidence. Just like pizzagate.
I can't upvote anything?
Is this the reason why my tab now says /all (filtered)  ?

I don't like you guys. At all. But this latest move is blatant censorship.   Fuck /u/spez
Already upvoted everything for like the past 8 months
Amazing how he messes up and figures the solution is to censor us...
Yeah, I never upvote anything... But when someone tells you your opinion is invalid, well it makes it a lot more interesting to spread it :).  Will be upvoting all the donald posts now. 
When we upvote it's slingshotting, when they upvote it's organic.  Got it.
**/u/SPEZ IS A CENSORING PIECE OF** a really good person who isn't a "cuck".   *This comment has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit the narrative of this website.*

Its time for our own site. 
I don't get it. He messes up and he doesn't get punished?
You know it's fucked up when they have to change the site's algorithms to block one subreddit from reaching /r/all. Subbed and upvoted

I already upvote every post
I have a serious question: How can Spez be a cuck when we know he has no genitalia?
Lol at 40% downvote and still over 7000, nothing can stop us
I've been the lead manager of communities before. There is no way in my opinion his apology should be accepted. His apology was kind of a joke to me. On his apology he has back handed comments about the community he screwed over by calling them bullies. It's the same kind of "apology" that sounds like. "I'm sorry you're upset at my actions." Instead of "I'm sorry I was wrong for what I did."
1984 is the government not only censoring speech, but literally publishing a new dictionary and torturing those who question authority.  I doubt you've read the book.
What did he do this time?... Just have a little time to research... thank you

#WORST. APOLOGY. EVER.
So now our subreddit is now considered venomous just because we don't fit reddit's stupid leftist agenda?  Sorry that you liberals have a conservative post getting to r/all once in a while as opposed to the nonstop liberal bullshit that permeates reddit. 
Fuck u/spez   #you pedophile limp wrist dbag
You see his TIFU non-apology? He basically says we're so horrible that he had to do it.
I don't have a problem with them creating a filter for /r/all.  But it's disgusting that the gif demonstration specifically suggests to people to censor the_donald.  Why should the CEO recommend to people that they SHOULD censor a specific group? 
An excerpt from my long reply to u/spez's announcement:  >This is just another set up to get your way. You did it with Ellen and in hindsight people figured it out, but somehow forgave you. You're doing it again - deliberately editing comments in r/the_donald knowing you'll get attacked. Then when the users of that subreddit naturally defend it, you label the whole community as trolls in an attempt to ban the entire sub. My guess is the reason you couldn't is because they're too big - you're the little guys now. Mark my words everyone, this is the first in u/spez's plan to ban r/the_donald. It's so transparent it's sickening.
Front page of r/all: ~5810 upvote average.  Front page of r/the_donald: ~6307 upvote average.  We *are* reddit!
>Welcome to 1984 folks.  George Orwell was a socialist, though. And this isn't government censorship, this is a private site doing what a private site pleases.
To be fair, lots of users have been complaining about r/the_donald posts showing up on the front page. Also, we were given the ability to filter all subreddits, not just the_donald
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuK1Yr35Io
/u/spez is a complete moron, and he thinks he is Big Brother or something. Fuck /u/spez Steve Cuckman
fuck /u/spez
I just sorted all by rising, thought I was on the_D for a at least 4 pages of scrolling, had to look up and remember it was actually /all.  This worked out great for them.
As an expert on 1984s, I can confirm this event's legitimacy as Orwellian.
the_donald really needs to take the opportunity and "make voat great (again)" or some other alternative. 
Wait, how is /u/Spazz censoring us. I thought he just added a filter? That's been a common feature in every app for Reddit ever and even RES. It needed to happen eventually.  At least nobody can complain about us now.
add to filter list: the_donald    was nice to meet you guys

Disgusting animal nu-male!
https://www.reddit.com/u/spez is  a typical numale cannibalistic pedo-enabling loser. If you are reading this spez (and we know you like to lurk) congrats on being a cuck and a parasite in the guts of free speech
This is purely anecdotal but more than one liberal Redditor friend of mine has said that he made the announcement to trash talk us. This will probably just unite more people behind us. 
I'm reading 1984 now and this is correct. The main character is a guy whose job it is to change things in print after the fact to align with what happened to make Big Brother look to be always correct. When Big Brother gets it wrong he edits things to blame others or make his over zealous predictions look to be more exact. This is what we can expect on reddit from now on. 
Something interesting I found in that thread. Regarding filtering All, he said:  "Yeah, sorry. I started working on back when we made the algo changes to r/all months ago, but I hit some spaghetti in the code and stopped. Last week I had the right combination of incentive and free time to get it done."  For a CEO, this seems weird for a few reasons:  1) People have apparently been asking for this for a long time. Voat did it a while ago, so it doesn't seem to be that hard to do. If it was a desirable feature, why did they have to wait this long to do it and why in the world would the CEO need to implement it? Shouldn't one of the regular engineers be doing this?  2) He talks about running into spaghetti code. It's his website! Shouldn't he know how the code works? And if running into some tangled code is enough to make him put something off for months, then he probably shouldn't be programming. Developers spend their lives wading through tangled code, and hopefully making it better.  3) He had to wait till he had the "right combination of incentive and free time" to implement a feature Voat easily implemented? It sounds like their software development staff is seriously lacking*. I guess spending all their money on socjus was a bad idea.  I get the feeling he and some mediocre programmers had an epiphany and made this in college, then pretty much just let it coast from then on without ever actually getting better at programming.  *To be fair, the network infrastructure staff is probably pretty good since this site scales huge world wide.
u/spez  rants and sudden, contradictory decisions are a sign of MENTAL ILLNESS. It's just as simple as that. I suspect some kind of psychotic breakdown. He's obviously, embarrassingly unfit ethically and psychologically to be running this site and has to step down. He fucked up too much and his walls of text make no sense. 
So what. When you surround yourself or sub(rpoltics) with only people who only see the same opinion as you, it becomes a useless discussion. This is what you get with a millennial liberal as a CEO. makes you wonder what really happened with the Asian CEO 
What's the keyboard shortcut to upvote, move to the next post, upvote, etc... ?
What an asshole.
Fuck /u/Spez

Thank you /u/spez for making space for your competitors at voat! I'm sure they welcome all free thinkers in their community. Reddit has turned into a bunch of cock gobbling cucks anyways. Where's my coat? I need to legally join voat 
We're too strong to be kept down fairly. 
And Moses said to Spez's land:   ##Let my centipedes go!
The interesting thing about this sub is that it has one very important thing in common with us filthy liberals: an ever burning hatred of sensorship and privacy infringement. I'll gladly up vote every post on this sub just for that
It's our fault, we triggered him to troll us. Fuck u/spez

216,145 Upvotes = The MOST Upvoted post in Reddit history. No, this post isn't asking for votes - It's simply to convey one message. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I'm Telling all of Redit to get ready for so much prosperity.    China is doomed and the Wall is going to be beautiful. 
When posts from /r/the_donald approach anywhere near the front page of /r/all, they are downvoted heavily. Typically, they end up being somewhere around 56% upvoted. For one of our posts to break a score of 216,145, we would actually need over 2 million upvotes. &nbsp;  And that assumes that the admins actually weight our upvotes equally, which is unlikely.  EDIT: /u/andrewism pointed out a miscalculation I made in the above scenario and it would *only* require a little over 1 million upvotes at 56% upvoted. However, if we went with the 52% upvoted that this thread has now achieved on the front page of /r/all, it would require over 2.8 million upvotes now to reach a score of 216,145.
This thread has 780,000 upvotes. The score is the number of UpTrumps over ShillBots.
Man I'm not even American and that pic made me proud

This is by far my favorite Trump image. It's been my phone's wallpaper for 2 months now.
The eagle with the machine gun around it's neck. Amazing artwork
Didn't you fellow centipedes hear?  We're not welcome on /r/all due to our incessant high energy.  Something about how we're winning too much and how it's unfair to the rest of the subs or some hogwash.
I'm getting that shirt for Christmas 
Awesome picture of our new president. The only explosions I see are the heads of liberals everywhere. 
Everyday a little greater.

Upvoted for that BADASS EAGLE in the background quietly machine gunning lol

Lets make the trump inauguration thread the most up voted post on reddit.

Really is such an awesome picture that triggers lefties everytime.
**THIS POST JUST GOT 10 UPVOTES HIGHER**
Just set that as my background. Awesome pic. Artist should get whatever artist's medal is given for bravery and courage.
I am fairly certain that is not an American made gun. REEEEEEE

Any court case that used a reddit post is now compromised. Thanks u/spez. 
Someone told me Trump admitted to sexual assault. I asked when he did that and he said "Are you kidding me?! Check the Access Hollywood tapes with Billy Bush."  So I looked at the transcript and Trump said "When you're a star, they let you do it." Let that sink in. "They let you do it." That phrase literally implies consent. That is not sexual assault. I can grab my girlfriend by the p*ssy and if she lets me do it then it is not sexual assault. The media twisted it.

When they send their CEO's they aren't sending their best, folks. 
"they let you do it"  LET = consent
Remember...how do we "break" reddit? There's just more of us. That's it. We outnumber the idiots by such a large number that posts calling out censorship and what not...  I'm a gay socialist and haven't felt more apart of a community. Can't talk about stuff like loving freedom and not wanting to get thrown from a rooftop elsewhere. 
omfg this is #1 of r/all.  #ATTENTION. TRUMP TRAIN INCOMING AT FULL SPEED. NO BRAKES.#
Why is noone calling for resignation?  Ellen Pao deleted a subreddit and reddit lost it's fucking mind.  This /u/spez deletes a subreddit and edits an entire threads comments, and all he gets is a couple of angry messages from 1/3 of the community on this site?  You need to go /u/spez.  I'm not sure what part of being CEO got to your head, but frankly it doesn't matter.  Clearly this position has gone to your head.  If you ever want to be considered for any other vaporware CEO, you need to resign NOW AND MAINTAIN YOUR DIGNITY.
Nah, man.  That implies a consensual interaction.  This was an assault.
Enough trump spam users still have no idea how to block sub reds it's from all.
We've got some bad hombres and we gotta get 'em out!

Here's to authenticity. 
No matter the situation or who's right or wrong, but the fact that the CEO or Reddit the one who advocates *freedom of speech*. Actually had the audacity to change certain comments to some users here worrying to the least and unfair to others. I'm amazed that the CEO has the power to change people's opinions or comments. Honestly I'm in shock.

Ku Klux 101:  Do NOT REMOVE YOUR FLIPPIN' HOOD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! EVER!
I think 'Hillary Clinton' needs to be at the start of the sentence
Victory for President Trump!
**Amazing ride! I love you guys let's stay in touch**

The MSM networks are sooooo fucking scared to call it for Trump right now. 
OH MY GOD WE DID IT - WE BEAT GEORGE SOROS  TOASTING IN EPIC BREAD
Wow. I'm like, genuinely amazed. This is the best time of my 23 years on this planet. I'm actually proud to be an American right now.      Excuse me, I think I'm tearing up a bit.
Watching the reactions of Clinton's supporters... they are fucking crushed.. they REALLY thought they we're going to win.. Please god, don't let Amy Schumer move to my country, Canada.
You know what this means?  **HILLARY GOES TO PRISON!**
America has been saved. The dumb ones just don't know it yet, but their children will learn about it, and all future generations

Remember guys, you don't want to trigger a response to Trump by acting like dick heads.    I've taken a lot of shit from shillary fans, but we gotta act like we've been there for. 
President Trump, the most deserving champion of all time. 💟 Praise God!
People are actually crying on the Hillary live stream,  so much shock from CNN it's insane,  what a day!

I can't believe I'm saying this unironically, but:  WE DID IT REDDIT
A phrase we won't ever hear: President Hillary Clinton.
#THREE Supreme Court Justices!  REPEAL of Obamacare! Amy Schumer moving to Canada! SO MUCH WIN!
CNN is basically rage quitting right now, this is the best part of the night 
You guys have really done something amazing.  Communication is changing, and you are at the forefront of swaying public opinion.  You are powerful masters of the public domain.  Good work r/TheDonald.  I take back every harsh word I've said about you!
CNN's Anderson Cooper: "What did the polls get wrong?"    Liberal media is stumped, baffled, flabbergasted at their complete and total failure to misinform, redirect, and undermine this election.    I'm loving every second of it.  As a first time voter, I couldn't be more proud to have participated.    Dear Hillary Clinton, family and friends:  Feel our anti-corruption fury.  See where cheating, lying, and obfuscation get you?  Now GTFO my train...
Why does it pause
#I knew my vote would be worth it!  - Coming from a Trump supporter from a (most likely) 90-95%  democrat big city in NJ!  It's a pleasure Centipedes!
#SOMEONE POST A BREAKDOWN OF WHY IT'S OVER FOR SURE PLEASE.
Not until 270. Let's not jinx it.
HEY CTR! IM TALKING TO YOU! FUCK YOU!
Well if this really happens. I am completely convinced that this sub did it. Completely 
HILLARY FANS ON SUICIDE WATCH
It doesnt end here centipedes! Next step CROOKED HILLARY GOES TO JAIL!!!
why are we doing victory posts why the fuck. we havent won yet
Still waiting for damn confirmation. I dont trust that woman. 
Congrats on taking your country back USA! Trump will be a fine leader ! Hillary was finally served some justice by the great patriotic citizens of America! God bless the USA.  -Canadian citizen 
Trump is going to have 8 years, then Pence 8 years. Hey cucks who are weeping right now: buckle up for 16 years of fixing your shitty leaders' mistakes.
I hope his victory speech is conciliatory and he opens the door to work with everyone.    As much as I'd love to see him say "you're fired" Hillary, I would rather him reach out to her supporters so we can start working together to get our country on the right track.

My Muslim roommate thinks he's gonna get deported, he's an American citizen lol
MAGA. you've proved everyone wrong until now Trump. Don't stop yet. 
this is so fucking surreal. 2016 is a crazy year. 
#GG EZ
I've got chills. I'm about to cry. This is the greatest thing my generation will ever accomplish.
Just a random kiwi guy that has watched the events unfold on reddit and irl throughout the years of hillary and trumps race.  Just wanted to say congrats to you guys for not taking the bullshit that the media forced on you guys all year, and for sticking with it HARDCORE from the start.  Congrats to everyone here who is a Trump fan as you guys got your asses out there and made it happen.
he won hours ago when he won florida, honestly he should just start his speech now so his supporters can go to sleep and have enough energy to stomp on some sjw in the morning 
YEAH Republicans LOCKED House , LOCKED SENATE....
Fuck.  Fine. You win, I cannot argue with that. Please govern this country well and use the power you have to benefit this world. That's all I can ask.
MAGA
IS THIS REAL, PLEASE DON'T TEASE ME?!?!
Even if he doesn't win Michigan he has Arizona + New Hampshire to fall back on which would put him at 269- and a tie at 269 goes to the Senate, which is republican... GG bois  Edit: and Maine could always drop in that single electoral vote >_>
Just a quick message to the Hillary supporters here that downvote everything...
Confirmed. If you think for one second I'm going to stand by quietly and allow someone to subvert and trample on our rights and freedoms, you're wrong.   What do you guys think this is all about? We're fighting EXACTLY that. Clinton would not have cared for you. Clinton would not have fought for you. She is the queen of duplicitous talk, saying one thing to your face and doing another, making promises she had no intention of keeping. She promised you a false paradise while undercutting our safety and security, and whoring out the might of the U.S. to her own financial benefit.   Donald Trump is not a man without faults. But he is one thing that we here all know, an American. He's proud of this country and proud of who he is. He wants this country to be great, and he wants the people here to be happy and healthy. He wants ONLY people that share that dream to come here, and not the people that hate us, that hate YOU. He wants to make it so those other people don't HAVE a reason to hate us, because we'll deal with everyone fairly and honestly, and they'll know from the outset that were there to benefit ALL of the U.S., not just a few.   He doesn't care if your black, purple, gay, trans, vegan, or missing two eyes and a leg, he really doesn't...and neither do we. If you want this country to be great and you're willing to pitch in with everyone so that we can go to other countries and hold our heads up high again, then you're one of us.   Trump is not the boogeyman. He's not the next Hitler. You've been presented with a false dilemma. You've been conned into believing that you have to reject the sacraligious notion, that the United States should look out for the U.S. and her people first, and shouldn't be interfering with other nations. To that end, you've been force fed a diet of hate, intolerance, and bigotry...and you wear this openly like a badge of honor, like a cross of persecution...even though no one has come to your door at night. No one has held you down. No one has victimized you. In fact, the very man you hate, the very supporters you hate here, are extending their hands out to you and saying "Look it's ok. We want things to be better and we want you to come too. You can be whatever you want to be, we just want you to be proud of our country again, because we DO GOOD THINGS."    Speddit: corrected "your", to "you're", because it apparently bothers the hell out of /u/CapnSheff down there...  
Couldn't have said it better Pede
I am a registered democrat. I was a Bernie supporter. And I don't comment often. However, I just want to say that the Dems rallying cries and complete lack of self-awareness about Clinton and the quickness to deflect the wikiileaks revelations of collusion and corruption with the media and DNC that subverted and undermined both the primaries and general election, coupled with their "Hillary is our only hope" attitude have left me disenfranchised from the Democratic Party. It is unbelievable and inexcusable. This period, now, could be used toward rebuilding the DNC and acknowledging that a horrible candidate was pushed against the will of the people-as evidenced by WIKILEAKS-to get to the point where we are today. Instead, they attack and refuse to accept all of what happened by pushing this clear bullshit of a Russian "hack" which has still to be publicly substantiated with evidence (when Wikileaks, which has a 100% track record of honest revelations has already stated the source was not Russia. I could honestly go on about this - like why the CIA leaked the report to the media instead of Congress, or why the CIA, who have not even publicly commented, are to be believed in the first place with their track record...or Assange alluding to the leak being Seth Rich yet no one fucking talks about that. I digress) I am rambling, but my point is: Fuck the Democratic Party for failing to see the leaks, which they were (not hacks), as anything other than revelations of corruption. What a bunch of cunts (also, those videos to the electors featuring Martin Sheen and bunch. Fuck everything about that.) Anyways, I am cautiously optimistic about what Trump will do but I believe he has great potential and beats the hell out of Hillary.  Quick note, too: I am a new subscriber to this sub but have seen the talk on threads that you guys are censored from reaching r/all /front page. What a bunch of bullshit. And one look at r/politics just makes me think all the pre-election favoritism that curried favor for Hillary is undoubtedly once again backing all the bullshit of the Dems in a contrived effort to push a nonsensical narrative that has become laughable.  Insert Buster Bluth gif - "I am one of you now." To be honest, not really. But I am closer to you than I will ever be to what they've become. 
86% upvoted.  EDIT: 56% Upvoted. Wow we hit a nerve!  They are triggered! This goes against the false narrative that we are behind someone no matter what! Sad!

We *elected* a President, we did not *anoint* a king.  The projections and presumptions of the disillusioned Cult-of-Obama are on vivid display,  alongside glaring ignorance of the Constitution.
Clinton supporter here, this is the sentiment we need to be spreading. No matter our political differences, we need to protect each other.
Was a Bernie supporter till the primary was stolen from him so I voted Trump. Friend on Friday said look at who I voted for and everything terrible he is appointing. I said am I not concerned with everything Trump is doing and I replied the man isn't even in office yet the media is trying everything to destroy him. But the moment he does anything that I find harmful to this country, you damn better believe I'm speaking up because I want great things for my children, family and countrymen.
As someone who supported Bernie before anything else, I feel bad for you guys for how the Media labels you all. I'm glad it wasn't Hillary. I wish it was Bernie, but I'll settle. I wish Donald good luck in the White House. Fair Enough?
Well said patriot 
I'm gay and I know how to shoot a gun, and believe you all should have your guns! If me and my boyfriend are in trouble, I can damn right guarantee a good citizen like you all will come to our protection if you are around us and notice it.
Freedom boner ENGAGED
Driving around Los Angeles today, I've never seen more Hillary for Prison bumper stickers. Proud of you LA! 
For the first time in probably ever, I actually like something from this sub. The makes me really happy to see this from you guys. I'd proudly stand with you as well to fight any of these injustices. 
It's a shame that the left can't or won't understand that we on the right are their best friends. Although we have different opinions as to what direction the country should go, we will stand up to oppression, even if it's against them.
Very fair, nice one.  Share it some place it can actually be heard.           It's getting downright hurtful the way we're treated anywhere outside of this forum.            I've made so many comments using as neutral and humble a tone as possible, conceding that if i can be shown I'm wrong I'll be happy to acknowledge it, but all i get is a few downvotes and once in awhile a weird deflection or irrelevant statistic.             I can't take it much longer, I've started just lurking /k/ on 4chan because I want to buy a gun some time soon (not related to politics, just been considering it awhile), and they don't ruin their board with constantly shitting all over President-elect Trump.           There are plenty of anti-Trump people there too, they just know how to stay on-topic and not piss and moan about everything.        They're quite focused on the stated topics there, it's very refreshing.           On reddit you'll find President-elect Trump bashing in any thread, it could be about golf and someone brings up his golf courses and how greedy and stupid he is for owning them.  It makes me sick, and genuinely sad for this website.   
they won't see this because of the new "filter from all" feature. what a stupid feature - it completely defeats the purpose of r/all.
#WEW LAD
Give the man a chance.  He won fair and square. I am a Bernie supporter, but I voted Trump because Hillary would be a complete disaster.  Plus, she needs to be put on trial.  She really does.  
As a Canadian: I agree and as a side note, please make Canada Great Again too!
If Trump did 1% of the shit dems say he does, i'd drop him in a second. Proof: I did it when Obama did a 180 in '08
rounding up US citizens? I'll not only support them, I'll pick up arms and fight for them.  But rounding up illegal aliens and enforcing existing immigration laws by deporting them? Then I'll applaud Trump for doing so. 
i miss when r/politics was actually about politics

There are only two things that I ask   1. Donald keeps to his promises   2. That the people judge him fairly on his a actions  No person should ask for more or less than this.
Nice! Well said.

 Hey /u/HH_Holmeskillet,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Was a Hillary supporter during the election and am by no means am a Trump supporter but yes this is very fair. I think Hillary supporters being whiny about the whole thing is shifting attention from the main topic at hand - the fate of the entire free world is in the hands of president elect Donald Trump and it is in our best interest to hope for President Trump's success.   Thanks OP for being one of the most rational posts I have seen on this sub. 
Too many characters, won't get read by the dumbest of the dumb. 
Too bad they don't care. To them you are still a deplorable and irredeemable fascist.
NO NOT FAIR!!! IT WAS HER TURN!!! (Sarc)
Downvote all you want, we'll shitpost more
As long as he gets the non-citizen Islamists out of the country, I'll be happy.    P.S. I love Muslims but hate fundamentalist Islam
I've largely become a lurker when it comes to politics on Reddit. But I just wanted to chime in and say how much this represents the way I feel.  I supported bernie and donated to his campaign, but I couldn't bring myself to vote for Clinton. I, a liberal to the core, voted for Trump. Because the few things I think he could actually change put him above Hillary more-of-the-same Clinton.   I disagree with Trump, and with a lot of people on this sub on many topics, but here's to hoping that we come out of it on top. 
The KKK ain't shit. Fucking boogeyman of Clinton. 
Just a note, you don't deport citizens, you deport people who are here illegally and I am A OK with that. 
You don't get it. Those aren't real concerns. They know Mr Trump isn't going to do those things. Their intentions are more evil than that. They say those things repeatedly in the media to propagandize the entire nation into thinking they are true. Do not bend the knee to these fucks. 
Can anyone honestly imagine seeing something like this on a liberal sub?
Someone tell me who wrote this:  >I believe in the American Dream. My business experience shows me that it works, and I want to do everthing possible to see that regular Americans can enjoy the same opportunity for success and security that I have had. That means the American Dream unencumbered by bureaucratic ineptitude, government regulation, confiscatory tax policies, racism, discrimination against women, or discrimination against people based on sexual orientation. We must all have equal access to the American Dream. It's a dream we deserve and a dream worth fighting for.  Oh wait, I found it. **DONALD J TRUMP**
And one look at r/politics just makes me sick, and genuinely sad for this website.
this is not good enough for them. You have to provide blowing bubble solution, play do, and an 8 year supply of juice boxes. that is merely the start of negotiations. 
This. Absofuckinglutely this.   If Trump does ANY of the things the left is accusing him of doing, then yea, I'll be the first to man up and say fuck this guy and actively do everything I can to make sure he is out of office.   But until then, they need to STFU, sit down, and watch as their country becomes great for not only themselves, but their children.   I'm sick and tired of hearing how Trump is Hitler and how he will round up all the Mexicans and people of Muslim faith and send them to concentration camps. I heard the left say they will round up the gays in the country and try to zap them straight. They spew out nonsense that gay marriage will be outlawed again. They fear that their kids will grow up under a dictator.   Grow the fuck up people. More than half of the country knew what it was doing when it voted for Trump. 
People said they were voting Hillary cause she was the "lesser of two evils".  But if you ask them why, the answer is always ad hominems against Trump.  "cause he's a bigot, a racist, a misogynist!"  And if you ask them to substantiate their claims, you get more ad hominems.  I don't get it.  How can you ignore all the shit Hillary did and pretend Trump is the "lesser of two evils"?  Really?  Hillary has a mile-long list of bad things she has done, and you want to pretend she is a saint?  She did all kinds of bad stuff to *her own party*, against Sanders!  How can people feign ignorance about that?
I know this isn't a popular opinion bur I'm not a fan of Trump I wanted Bernie but FUCK Hillary especially after she and DNC fucked Bernie out of the race.
The first, and probably only /r/T_D post I will upvote.
Get this to the top please.
They know all of that, they just don't give a fuck. What they really want is to eliminate that half the country to usher in their new utopia. A utopia, they've actually convinced themselves these crooked elites will allow them to have LOL.   At no point have these idiots asked themselves, if the protection from these trump supporters ends (welfare, military, police, etc) whats stopping China (or any other country) from moving in?
I was replying to a very 'concern-trollish' comment that suddenly got deleted, but I wanted to share it anyway.  Please read and let me know what you think:           >Regarding the "he said he'd drain the swamp and now he's filled it right back up by appointing so-and-so" ...       >I said this earlier about a different post, but it looks like instead of career politicians who owe favors to half the other nations in the world, he's appointing CEO's, people who are experienced exec's.  And yeah, they've been running private companies, with holdings in other countries (not *just* Russia, believe it or not), and in doing that they have exploited legal tax laws and loopholes, and leveraging their competitive advantages to maximize profit, because *that's their obligation to their shareholders.*  And they're *good* at it.  And now, **the American people just became their "shareholders."**      >Trump's whole platform, as i saw it, was based on putting an end to this long over-esteemed strategy of running our country like a charity organization for the rest of the world, hemorrhaging money, piling up trade deficits and incurring an insane and growing national debt.....           >Instead, intending to run it much more like a business.  Get that debt down, get our trade deficits down, actually supply things to other countries in a TRADE context, rather than just foreign aide and endless, vaguely purposed wars that do nothing for our country.  Get the markets facing north again, get our GDP growth to a respectable level, take down unemployment.           >These are the things we voted for.  Not "gay kid shock-therapy internment camps" or "hooray for the KKK!" or "no mexicans/muslims allowed."      >We voted for these things because they're going to help all of us provide a better future for our children and better lives for ourselves and our families and our neighbors.  Clinton voters, muslims, blacks, latinos, gays, trans-whatevers, everyone.           >And I truly believe that, in his heart, President-elect Donald Trump is doing his very best to appoint the people he thinks can and will do **those** things, and do them as well or better than anyone can do them.           >Stop obsessing over President-elect Trump's Twitter, of all things.  He won, we're happy, and he deserves a chance to serve our country before anyone says jack shit, to be quite frank.  And I do not mean like three days.  Or three weeks.  He might need years to show results.  But he's earned at least four, and that's what we're gonna get, and all this bickering and concern trolling is not constructive to anyone's agenda.

As a liberal, well said!
Basically, if Trump becomes the tyrant they think he is, I'll oppose him. But until then I'm going to continue to believe this is all sour grapes.
This is like..... Really fair and reasonable. Cheers.
To be honest I don't think it is fair enough. One of the biggest mistakes the right-wing establishment has ever made is being entirely too soft on the opposition. You want to be "nice" to your opposition? You want to tell your opposition that "you will fight for them"? (And I know you mean it).  Well that's great but you're talking to a group of people who looks down on you and thinks it's a service to the world when you die. Keep this attitude and you will lose. You will lose slowly, as the Republican establishment did for many years, but you will lose.   The reason Trump won is because he hit back. It's not about violence. It's not about hatred. It's not about anything "they" try to portray it as, but IMO it **IS** about 100% dropping that attitude that we are somehow beholden to the evil people who intentionally manipulate, deceive and celebrate the deaths of the best of us.
This shit is healing as fuck
If I was ever in a situation where I was being personally abused or attacked for whatever reason, I would count on any 'pede here to help me out without hesitation.  In comparison, I would have near zero confidence in any liberal snowflake putting their pretty words into actual helpful action.
fair enough.
lol just by seeing the downvotes you cna tell how many of them are in here.. like roaches in light
Im a pretty left leaning guy myself (apart for guns) and honestly I think we (myself included) blow it out of proportion a lot. Anytime you have the situation we have now where people stick to their bubbles, than the only thing they see of the opposing side is the very extreme. For us, we see the Alt-Right calling for a purge of jews and muslims and I assume you guys only see the tumblr cry-bullies. I try to read the echo chambers of both sides (info-wars, salon.com) but even I often see the entire right as a hate group, I can only imagine what the people who only stay in their left wing bubbles see you guys as. Every now and again I see something like this that kind of levels my head... Also, ill be the first to admit my people don't understand satire when it's not from them.  **TL;DR**  I'm a lefty ^(non-hillary voter) and this is a nice post. I don't think a lot of people on the left see you guys as this post.
I really hope someone is running a downvote bot on these threads. How sad would it be if they are manually down voting each post. 
68% up voted, whenever I stop believing CTR is a real thing on this board, top bait like this brings them all out 
Fucking hell.  Love this.

Honestly, Christie was my original candidate but I got myself educated and learned about Trump and realized very quickly that he wasn't your usual pandering politician. Even though I voted for him, I hold him to the same, if not more, standard that I expect from him. Even of this vitriol, it's the biggest expenditure of energy I've ever seen. Give him a fucking chance. I'm thankful I live in a red state so I don't have to keep my head down when I'm at work/out about town.
Also, if he rounds up all lgbt's to send them to conversion camps.  Which will never happen, but some people apparently seem to think it will. Trump is here, for everyone. He wants to heal a divided nation.
That's pretty gay tbh fam
Why is this #1 on /r/all, but it's not #1 on my personal front page?
Yeah, but...He should deport all illegals, though, by any means necessary.
That's racist.
Does this come in popup book format? Not entirely sure if common core supports reading on this level yet...
This is too reasonable. They'll never get on board with this 
Fair enough.
Fair dinkum.
Have to say... THAT IS PRETTY FAIR!
Amen.
You're a god damned partiot, centipede
soros paying anarchists and black racists to riot
Well, trump has already said he's not going to reverse gay marriage rights because it's already set in and that would be divisive. However for the deportation...they're here illegally, get out. 
Great 📯. Post
Fair Enough 
#reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Amen
Um, I'm totally cool with rounding up and deporting all *illegal* immigrants. What's next? Are we not going to prosecute murderers? If a 13 year old kid takes the wheel of his mom's van, is he just an "undoccumented driver"?
Stop virtue signaling and punching right.   They're attempting to steal electors, disrupt the inauguration, and many wish death upon who we elected.   They don't care what you say.   They're going to keep calling you every name in the book because they disagree with you.   This is how the movement slowly becomes co-opted. 
*Republic
This has been my stance since November 8th. Trump talks a big game and I hope to high heaven his administration does good for this country but if not there will be hell to pay.    I voted for Trump because I felt that Obama was just a corporate tool cleverly disguised. He did some bad things for America and nobody noticed because they were too busy sucking his dick because he's the first black president. Obama was a letdown, sure he could have done worse but when you promise "change" and it's just a change of bread from white to wheat on the shit sandwich then the people who expected a turkey club are going to be pissed.  I hold Trump to the highest expectations and if he does turn out to not be what he promised then I will be in the fist wave of people trying to clammer over the White House fence to Gadaffi him.  
Too logic based, libtard system error
But...but buzzfeed said trump supporters are literally the Gestapo and the SS 
We'll said sir. And I as a "bleeding heart liberal" shall stand with you also.
Occupy Democrats, everybody.
Hard to tell if it's BLM or the Democrats
Aren't they funded by George Soros?  Well, we got him!  The 60 Minutes interview video Soros tried to bury!  [Check it out!](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5cmih7/we_got_him_the_60_minutes_interview_soros_tried/)

I'll probably get banned since I haven't disavowed but I'm a Democrat and not all of us think like this. It's a shame too. I share the same label as these rioters. This might not be the place to rant about it though. I just don't get my fellow Democrats' thought process. We shit on Republicans for 8 years and viewed them as immature. If we do the same thing we will be disregarded just as the Republicans were disregarded for 8 years.  I don't understand why people want trump to fail. He was elected and now I respect him and hope he wins me over as a president, even though he did not win me over as a candidate. We are all Americans and should be working together. To improve America, not try to stop each other from trying to improve America. Rant over. I needed to say it somewhere.  I just hate seeing all these liberals making the whole party look retarded. Gimme the ban. 
#LIBERALS ARE HYPOCRITES?! SHOCKER!!!!!!!!!!
# All about Occupy Wall Street CO-FOUNDER Aaron Black, yes the self-described "DNC Rapid Response Director" from 2 Veritas videos (linked below) - >>  # https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/duplicates/58mk8i/yuge_uncovering_aaron_black_of_democracy_partners/  See him here - watch for 2 minutes (starting at 8:40):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IuJGHuIkzY&t=8m40s  And again here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b24Yq1Ndnjo
One of my liberal friends who voted for Trump said this to me after the election: "Liberals go out and protest. Conservatives go out and put asses in Congressional seats."   Sounds about right. 
The irony is fucking unbelievable 
More and more Evidence/indicators are coming in that these Protests are not organic, and are pre-planned, large scale organized(such as being bussed around and ordered on the ground), 100% Soros/DNC created and that Hillary gave the order to activate.  BLM was a test run for these Protests and shares alot of similarities tactics wise. If you consider the O'Keefe videos this looks like a large scale "incident violence at rally's using crazy people" aswell.

[deleted]
Are they paid by soros?
President: Republican House: Republican Majority  Senate Republican Majority Media: Democratic Majority   As if the 4th estate even matters when they will be overridden by the top 3.
Everyone that I'm Facebook friends with who reposts shit from Occupy Democrats is the cream of the idiot crop. As if their uneducated economic views aren't bad enough, the hypocrisy and straight up moronic views take them to a whole new level. That might be the dumbest group of human beings on the Internet
"waaaaaa we lost  lets change the rules!!!" Get out and take noted child molester Lena Dunham with you.
[deleted]
>No cooperation  Do they realize Republicans won the Senate and Congress too?
How are they going to obstruct without a majority? The government is all majority red now.
"Give republicans a dose of their own medicine"  Well a lot of Trump supports aren't Republicans, also I don't remember anyone rioting in 08' and 12'...
I wouldn't mind all those protesters getting locked up with their queen Hillary for treason.
I've never seen such a massive simultaneous outcry of spoiled children masquerading as adults 
Working on his re-election already.
#S O R O S
It'd be fine if they were just protesting, but they're rioting and destroying their communities. Communities that are already blue.
I'm no Trump supporter but this is a load of shit. He's president and we need to pass legislation for the good of the people, not get "revenge" on the other party. What a bunch of babies.
I voted for Hillary, but i'm not one of these people. I respect the office of the president. I'll vote again in 2 years and vote again in 4.
Occupy Democrats are a bunch of retards 
Why dont they just ask everybody for anarchy instead of sugar coating?
The funny thing: Obama was given EVERYTHING he asked for — his plan was to fuck it all up - that was the point.
So ironic that Barry is the least patriotic POTUS of all time and Trump loves America. It's our DUTY to not let up on the red pilling of our fellow citizens still in the matrix. Don't get cozy bc we have a proper POTUS, keep pushing wikileaks and esp the dark truths of the Clinton Foundation. Trump still needs our help to MAGA. 
Hypocrisy = Leftism.
Lol they actually said SHUT IT DOWN!
Funny that a bunch of whiny bitches and beta nu-males think they can shut anything down 😂
One of the saddest parts of this election has been seeing how many of my friends think Occupy Democrats is a legitimate news source
And they wonder why people call them the hypocritical left.
I got myself unbanned from this sub after a full election cycle of unabashed "cuckery" just so I could speak out about this kind of thing: Trump *is* going to be President, and I plan to support him in that. I don't want to make him fail, I don't want to screw over our country. I value our democracy, and that means, at least eventually, falling in some sort of line. Now, I do love the (non-violent) protests, and [so does Trump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/797034721075228672), it seems. But eventually we've got to get down to it, and actually run this dang country.
MODS = GODS
The Regressive Left
Here's what baffles me about all of these protests: Trump isn't even in office yet!!! He hasn't even officially done anything as President! If something happens where peoples' safety is threatened, or even if they don't agree on something, by all means make your voice heard! That is a part of democracy! But what are these people even protesting? The fact Trump won an election? 
#**THEY KNOW, SHUT IT DOWN**
Shut it down!
I do not support Trump, but I completely agree that this hypocrisy is ridiculous. Even Obama said that we should want Trump to succeed because if he does, it means that America succeeds. 
Lol he's not even inaugurated... MAGA IS COMING FOR YOU!!
Genuinly, from a guy that loves Sanders and hates trump, I'll give him the absolute benefit of the doubt. He's about to be the leader of this country for a while, and I'm not going to root for America's failure.     I'm terrified that he's appointing people that don't believe in climate change, but I'm not going to burn anyone in effigy before they even show us what they want to do. I'm scared that he wants to deregulate so many businesses when we saw mortgage lenders almost melt the world economy just 9 years ago, because it was so easy to slip by regulations that keep consumers safe. But he hasn't *done* anything irresponsible yet, and he may have plans to account for this. God I hope so.      And I know the-donald's prime export is shit posts often for gags, but any reasonable people here realize that as a percentage, almost no democrats are protesting. I don't think most of them are demonstrating and rioting because they're democrats, but because they think donald is against their race or gender. I think it's always just been angry people, not a *party* that's gone overboard with these public reactions.     I'm not going to fight a guy that legally won a contest, and hasn't fucked anything up so far. I hope he does well. I hope the environment  comes out the other side when this is done. I hope violent people on either side stfu and go home.     But before I get banned again, let me just say that the-donald is going to have to find a way to comfortably settle into reddit. I get that you had to fight an uphill battle, but you're not going to have much of an audience to talk smack to anymore if reddit becomes the-donald. I'm not saying you can't or shouldn't call out subs like \politics, but if this sub forever works in overtime like it did in the primaries, everyone's going to get tired of it and block you out or leave. Many of us had an interest in keeping the competition in their feed during the race, to see what the other side was up to, but you've won. I've got no reason to listen to bashing now. I know everyone here wants some payback, just like \hillary4whatever would if they won, but it just makes more people dead-set against trump. That won't help *anyone.*   Good luck, really.  
MODS = GODS
Marxist terrorists. All of them. This PC cancer needs to end and fast.
Hypocrats
Every time I see occupy democrats on my Facebook feed I just laugh  They're completely delusional and they don't live in reality.  Bunch of idiots straight up lying about trump and everything they don't like
You know what would snap these liberals back to reality before you could blink?  Jail time. Let them know it's for real.
Good luck when Republicans control   Senate   House   SC   Governorships   Executive branch   Justice dept   State dept
LOL. Literally SHUT IT DOWN.
Let's occupy their seats in another 2 years.  
Now imagine these types of people coming to power and arresting anyone who disagrees with them.  Oh wait, that would've happened under Hillary.
Shiftless scum that they are, they can always fall back on "lol not my president" to avoid seeing themselves as hypocrites.
The lefts memes are incredibly pathetic and low energy.
Go to your safe spaces 
[I just went to check if this hypocrisy was indeed posted by Occupy Democrats.](https://www.facebook.com/OccupyDemocrats/photos/a.347907068635687.81180.346937065399354/1303994179693633/?type=3&theater) Which in turn, I find it rather hilarious that liberals can never provide GENUINE evidence to support their racism, sexism, xenophobic claims against Trump.
That can't even say it's a reaction to republican behavior in response to Obama cause they did the same shit to Bush.
holy shit, a mild democrat here (plz dont kill me) and this is retarded
So exercising first amendment rights is treason?   We have the first amendment for the sole purpose of being able to question the government.  Attempting to deny those rights is treasonous, not exercising them.
I think all these snowflakes need are participation trophies. 
Liberals don't actually have values.  They just have things they say to get something they want. Hypocrisy is perfectly consistent for them. 
Personally not even a Trump supporter, but god damn they are fucking stupid. what a joke
Doesn't matter.    We control the House, Senate, States, and Federal government. Even better, if we deport all of the illegal immigrants as promised (millions voted) and institute voter ID laws, we will win every election for the forseeable future. We are going to make America great again even if we have to drag them kicking and screaming.
The best part is that their congressmen can't do jack - congress is all republican!      So not only are they exposed as whiny children, but their temper tantrum will have zero impact.     Ahhhh, this is a good feeling.
Kiss the ring or I reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Hopefully their parents kick them out of their basements soon
There's a lot of cancer on Facebook. OD is stage 4 and has metastasized. 
Defying the President is considered treason? Holy shit, and they call us the fascists... 
Remember the cardinal rule of the regressive left: If they do it, it's okay, but if anyone else does it, REEEEEEEEEEEE
Nobody ever accused these goons of rising above the fray.
They don't even try to hide their hypocrisy, they just count on the stupidity of their people not to notice and/or care.
This is what the tolerant left looks like.
They don't seem to understand what happens when you lose the national election in epic fashion.
Yea. Good way to show how much better the Dem tactics are than the GOP's. /s
The hypocrisy on the left is never ending
Let the butt-hurt flow 
You can actually hear the tears fall as this hits the front page
[deleted]
I'm a dem who supports Trump, not all of us are cucks. Can we bridge the gap and work together?
Typical hypocrites... 
Occupy Democrats is run by a bunch of race-baiting white kids. I investigated them years ago. One of them was arrested for sexual assault of a minor. His brother ran for State Senate in Florida
Neither of those things are treasonous. Both are super shitty, but treason is a very specific and serious thing. 
It's almost not even news worthy that democrats are hypocritical shit stains on America.
Come over to the right side. 
That beauty of a House majority tho.
We need to get their bus schedule.
Leftists using the symbol of an old, white guy that embodies patriotism and American exceptionalism  Top Kek
It's not going to do anything because the republicans control all 3 branches of government and Trump is going to use that to his full advantage.
Well, it will be kind of difficult to for the Soros Shadow Govt to get enough people to obstruct a Trump Presidency when *they can't even get enough people to obstruct the Trump Tower...*  http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/11/protest-election-donald-trump-tower/  > law officers awaited rhe group of **about 100 protestors**  meaning, MAYBE 50 melting snowflakes...  On a Friday Night...   **IN NEW YORK CITY.**  Good luck with that, y'all...  
the sun will set, the liberals will waddle home, and donald trump will still be president for the next 4 years.  deal  with  it.
I don't understand the whole obstruction argument. People with opposing views from Democrats elected those Republicans to work on their behalf. If they aren't working to stop legislation or an agenda that is against their constituents wishes they wouldn't be doing their jobs. Kind of the reason they were sent to Washington in the first place. It's not obstruction, it's working on behalf of your constituents and their desires.
Lmao good luck obstructing with a republican congress in both houses, bitch.
How can these liberals even think straight? Their views are always changing and they don't truly know what they stand for.
Good luck with that. We control both houses in Congress in addition to Trump being the president.
Sore losers
This is actual, complete hypocrisy. If one was to pull out their dictionary and look up hypocrisy, this would be an example. I mean this is utter ignorance and actually nonsense, rabble. Unless they actually mean they want to commit treason and are openly supporting treason.

I haven’t received a single message from reddit yet
WHERE'S MY AUTOMATED WARNING, REDDIT? I'VE BEEN UPVOTING EVERYTHING!
Love the pledge of allegiance
It really is the best fuckin flag.
Reddit is so woke, they're actively TRYING to run off people who make them money.  In any normal business, you try to not piss off the producers who are making you money.  I guess I don't understand the social media business.
Fuck these admins. I might just delete reddit.
Fuck u spez you pinko commie piece of shit!!!
Trump's average approval ratings hit all time high at Realclearpolitics. Maybe somebody will make a post about it?
Physically cannot upvote... am Canadian

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all
Warn me reddit! You won't.
I’ve been upvoting all this stuff and I haven’t gotten a single message. I feel a little left out.
Remember when Nancy Pelosi recited the pledge of allegiance before the impeachment, as though most of the Democratic Party nowadays (at least millennials and younger) actually likes America? What a laugh that was, indeed.
I can’t post on the_donald.   BUT TAKE MY UPVOTE!

Looks like everyone got banned
I approve this post
I’m not upvoting enough, I haven’t got a warning
Fuck reddit.  Updoot The Pledge!!!  I LOVE DONALD TRUMP!
Strangely I am restricted from Posting here. Something smell fishy!
Reddit cucks can suck commie DONG
Admins haven't harassed me yet.
I hope Reddit bans me for supporting my president!
**God bless America, my home, sweet, home**
Pledge was written by a socialist.  Also we were supposed to be many nations with a federalist system.  I hate this “one nation” idea.  California is not the US, and who the fuck would want that anyways?

Fuck these incipient little commissars and their over the top censorship.
Fuck Reddit
Last post. See ya guys.   I will celebrate Trump's win with You guys on a site that promotes freedom.
Awaiting my first message in the vote harvesting shenanigans.
Been upvoting every td post and comment I can still no message. I was looking forward to being banned for wrong think.
If you have Twitter tweet @Trump and let’s get him to do an AMA here. Its time he did again and it will get the eyes on this sub to potentially save it
yoi forgot about israel! nothing about protecting israel is written there ?
How many do you need to get banned for good? Got two so far.
It takes a few hits with my thumb but it does up vote
MURICA
Give me your message, Spez. I just gave you mine. Semper Fi
I havent gotten shit yet! Is this how Eminem feels with the GEOTUS doesnt respond to him?! Haha
Apparently I'm not even allowed to submit posts here.  This is some bulls*%$.
No message here.
Another?  I never got the first one!!
I use to always say "Amen" at the end of the pledge as a kid.
God bless America, from an Indian who knows that you guys are fighting the most important fight on behalf of the entire free world.
[Last one out](https://i.imgur.com/PEUkKVP.png)
You have a lot of updoots.
I don't support Trump. I've always voted Democrat, though I'm registered as an independent in the event I want to vote Republican. Because let's face it. You never know.  I do not support the message of this sub and the stuff posted because obviously it does not fit into my ideals as a person.   But I will stand with each and every one of you fags to fight the fascists that are the reddit admins.  I'm going to subscribe to this sub and I am going to upvote every single post I see in solidarity with all of you faggots. This is the internet. You cannot censor a person's right to speech or expression.   The moment we allow the admins to dictate what people can say and post is the moment reddit is lost forever.

FUCK YEAH!!❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸❤️❤️ HEY SOEZ JUMP ON THE TRUMP TRAIN YOU BABYBACK BITCH AND ENJOY THE RIDE!!! TRUMP 2020!!!
Fuck it. Why not.
I have lost ALL my "posting" tabs....says you need to be an approved user to post????  Anyone else have this problem?  Posts sitting on my screen are 1 day old and nothing new seems to be appearing???
The pledge of allegiance was created as a marketing ploy to sell flags to schools.  I am 100% absolutely not making that up. Look into it.
Fuk u
Well looks like this was my last post Pedes! I’m no longer allowed to post here on T_D. Fuck Spez and come over to TheDonald.win where everyone gets two scoops!
Or you could stop giving reddit traffic, go into your dashboard and deactivate all your accounts like I'm about to do.
Where’s my message?
Amen
1790 is the key: https://i.imgur.com/iEfxQCj.png  Leftists worked hard to dismantle what we should have taken foregranted. Diversity just breeds distrust the more of it there is.
Waiting...
As a person with —- uncommon —- religious and political convictions, I remove a comma, so it reads, “... one nation, under God Indivisible...”.   That way, it is God Who is indivisible, whereas the several States _can_ secede from the Union if they decide to.   Many here would, I suspect, champion the prospect of California (for example) seceding from the Union, or parts of that State seceding from Cali to form their own State(s) and then petitioning for Statehood under the American Republic we all love so much.   YMMV.
...and I am not even an American!
Grew up believing in this. Thank GOD I still do despite the BS those idiots in the left preach!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍 GOD, COUNTRY, FAMILY!!!
So now we can upvote our own flag and pledge?
Wonder if my account will be targeted...
Hong Kong #1, Down with China.
What’s separation of church and state?
The pledge is rooted in socialism. Pledge allegiance to the ideas in the constitution, not a flag.
Like every other comment I've made about this censorship problem,  Fuck spez, fuck ass hoe china, and fuck the pedocommie lef-tits.  That is all.
research flat earth  globalism is literally and figuratively a big fucking scam
Pledge of allegiance is bull shit.  Especially the “one nation, under god”. The justice for all is probably the biggest joke in the whole thing.  We all know there is no justice here for a whole lot of us.  Please don’t ban me for this, but this is how I feel.
i pledge allegiance to the bag
this is racist
You know who else pledged allegiance to a flag?  The nazis.  /TDS

i have issues with 'under god' part of this.
Gotta day America.  Having kids say the pledge daily is lowkey creepy.

I didn’t expect my mom to bring me some tendies but I’m literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I’m going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is she losing? This can’t be happening. We're all coming together to Make America Great Again. I don’t want to believe the Democrats are so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Donald to be president and fix this broken country.

One of Rorschach's best lines in Watchmen. I'd highly recommend watching the Ultimate Cut once in your life. It's worth it. All 3hrs and 35 minutes of gloriousness

Well, the pegging probably keeps him up at night but I am sure that you guys aren't helping. 
Reddit is his love and we're cucking him with it.  
This really makes me feel like in a fucking movement haha.  And you know what? in a minimal sense we are one, here on reddit.  We go the other way around, we get downvoted for our opinions, but nothing will stop us, we are strong enough that people think and are fucking sure we have bots, sorry it's just HIGH POWER!
I've heard a lot of people say that u/spez is a cannibal and pedophile. I'm not saying that, I don't think he is, but I've heard a lot of people saying it.
I love you.

The sooner they'll admit they don't want their echo chamber disturbed in any way, the sooner all conservative users can leave Reddit. 
Doesn't work like that. If a post was every stickied it won't appear in r/all. This is evident by the lack of threads from here currently at r/all, they were removed as the update came and they were stickied.

/u/spez, the site's admin, has placed a soft-quarentine on this sub after failing to control our influence on Reddit. Along with his editing other users comments without their knowledge he decided to just silence /r/the_donald and keep our sticky posts from appearing on all. We're back on all by sheer force of upvotes baby!!

Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of spicy tendies and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of spicy tendies out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results on /r/all. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck can't /r/the_donald stop winning? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a suppressive algorithm to believe in! I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought they supposed to be suppressed from /r/all?!?!?!? This is so fucked.
I'm not all that happy about trump winning, But wishing bad luck for him is like hoping your pilot crashes the airplane because you don't like him.
I need more of this  #THANK GOD FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP
could someone tell me what does btfo mean? 
#Oh the savagery lol
Seriously, they can talk all they want about "that's not presidential" GOOD! I hope hes not like the past few presidents. It's time for one of these to not be like the others. The more I hear that statement, the more I will be glad he is there.

Thank you for identifying the biggest problem facing our nation. More people need to think of the consequences of their actions and how they affect the greater world around them that way we could have strong leaders who can fix world problems and not have to deal with domestic ones such as an extremely divided nation.   Both parties need to be willing to come together on the middle ground and stop with the all or nothing mentality. Party before country is a dangerous mentality no matter if it's the Democrats or Republicans.   That being said perhaps if you wanted more "limp wristed weak little sissies" to hear your opinion and value your insight, turn down the aggression and meet them in the middle. It works wonders to be nice!
Yes, the tendies have truly relocated to the floor with this picture of Trump.   What must it be like to be so easily triggered and so consistently fail?

I don't care if that old bitch is doing fake ass charity work; tell me why Obama got a pizza bracelet from another grown ass man WHILE this pizzagate shit is picking up. Truth getting too damn big for you guys to handle? because there is no justification for this blatant attempt to CONTROL what people DESERVE to know.   You could have easily just implemented the /r/all filter without singling out us.

People are missing the point. All it does is prevent the abuse of stickied posts.  Plus, Trump isn't president yet, he isn't in office yet.
Why is the sky so dark and menacing?
Nope. /r/The_Donald posts can now no longer reach /r/All. 
That image looks like it was made in 2005 or something.

Weird, I thought liberals only like free stuff 
Think you missed the reading comprehension class because no stickied r/the_donald posts can reach r/all. All others are fine
And yet here you are commenting on the sub you hate so much.  
We aren't homophobic, we have LGBT flairs to the right... turn off CNN's brainwashing or go outside (you won't) and talk to Trump supporters. You come here and act like a dipshit expect to be thrown out.
"legally" lmao there's nothing illegal about pinning a thread, stop drinking u/spez shit flavored kool-aid.
Admins are now censoring our stickies from r/all. Don't tread on memes!

Honestly,  the past couple of years I've seen tons of posts asking everyone to contact political leaders and put a stop to the TPP.  Trump kills it the first week in office and now I see all these comments on how fucking awesome TPP was.  I'm almost done with this shit hole site.
hahahaha literally fucking hysteria
I think that was sarcasm.  Although with the left, hard to tell.
the man could shit gold and fart rainbows but people would call him a monster for taking jobs from leprechauns.
[astroturfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing)  Soros & friends pay people to riot IRL, risking their lives. You don't think they'll pay people to do it online too?
The seed of doubt has been sowed. We just need a bit of time to let it grow.   Trump will convince them through results. All we need is time. 
Bernie was a shill, but even he can pull aside differences to work with Trump. I don't know why random internet accounts can't do the same.
"wtf I love the tpp now"  Stop making memes real.
WTF I LOVE TPP NOW
lol this is lower than toddler mentality.  These libs are only concerned with one thing: agreeing with each other in the pursuit of not having one original thought.  Just whines, whines, whines. 
I didn't vote Trump. But, I also didn't vote Clinton.  But to make a blanket statement that you aren't going to support someone even if they make good decisions and help thing move forward is beyond me. He has a chance here to really make a difference. I don't know why people want to see him fail. That does nobody any good.
I wouldn't call myself a Trump supporter per say but you have gotta have something wrong with you to hope that he fails. Extremely unamerican
These guys are so dumb to the point they are behaving like children. It's like when you tell a kid not to do something and out of spite they do the exact opposite.

I have a feeling there's going to be a lot of this over the next 8 years.
I see it all over reddit still. "I hate Trump but that was a good thing". They gotta make sure you know that no matter what he'll do they will hate them.
Have never supported Trump. Was devastated when he won. But I do like that he nixed TPP. 
The thread over on REDACTED is full of cancer.
Congratulations to the media, George Soros, and the left writ large: you have succeeded in brainwashing a large group of people to the point where they will oppose things that they were for, or that are obviously in their own interest, just because of the person doing it. And at the same time, not even really having a concrete reason for doing so, or knowing why when asked.  I nominate you all for the Goebbels Propagandist of the Year Award.
Ladies and gentlemen, your host, cognitive dissonance. 
Pride before country.
Literally the only post I've ever up voted in this sub.  I can't understand the hate from the left.  I'm neither so no bias.  He IS our president.  I will support his good decisions that I agree with and that benefit me.  Just like any other politician disregarding their party.
Getting real hard for the sub that shall not be named to keep hiding their true form from the rest of reddit !
Yeah I'm no fan of Trump, but this is a very significant step forward. Or at least it's not a significant step backward that was planned and about to be orchestrated by the Democrats.
Honestly didn't want Trump for pres, but I can't lie, he's made some kickass moves in just two days. It's gonna be a wild ride.   #NOBRAKES
at least that person is being honest.
And yet _we're_ the **real** circlejerk.
Hey guys, I disagree with most of Trump's policies and actions, but I am very happy to hear this with how backwards the TPP is. (We do need *something* in terms of trade partnerships eventually though)  Just because you support the other side doesn't mean you can't agree with certain things from the other. Anyone who hates something specifically because the opposite side opposes it/sides with it, needs to reform their political opinion. I don't think its good to classify that all liberals are like this, I think there are extremists on both sides.  Whichever political views you have, I hope these next 4 years are a good presidency.
More proof liberalism is a religion.

Trump could promote a cure for cancer and the lobs would label him a murderer of cancer cells and start an activist group for the cells.
As a foreigner this basically is american politics. Your team needs to win, and the other team needs to lose. Which makes Trump a true outsider because both sides hated him :). 
Trump: "We need to support our Jewish community" Liberals: "GAS THEM ALL REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
Now /redacted is *against* term limits. 
This is the turning point. It's been amazing today watching the flood of manufactured anti-Trump hate turn into a trickle and be drowned out by legitimate discussion and kudos for this great move by our president. All of the top comments on a worldnews thread today were positive and the die hard anti-Trump comments were at the very bottom and reduced to childish attacks.   This is our helm's deep so to speak on Reddit. This is the part where the tide turns and the shills start to lose the war. We've already won the war that mattered mind you, but its nice to actually talk about Trump outside of the Donald. 
Reddit likes what's it's told to like
As much as I am opposed to him, decisions made that are in line with my personal politics I can wholeheartedly get behind.
That's the stupidest thing ever; there's plenty I don't agree with Trump on, but if he does something good policy wise you can't fucking not support it because he's not on your "team"...  For christ sake, the fucking TYT host Cenk defended the fuck out of trump today as a matter of fact for his stance on TPP and they're about as left as you can get.
I swear to god I'm embarrassed to have ever been associated with these hypocritical MFers.   I finally had to get rid of my Facebook account before I started saying things I was gonna regret to people I love.   "If it's wrong when Bush did it, then it's wrong when Obama does it! If it's right when Obama does it, it doesn't become wrong when Trump does the same damned thing. JESUS CHRIST! "  Sorry, I had to get that off my chest. I'm sick of everyone running around with their hair on fire and I'm sick of losing respect for people I credited with rational thinking. 
Fucking retarded people lol. Lemmings.
The brain washing is strong with this one...
LOL wtf is wrong with people? "Let's hope the current president is the worst ever and drags our country down into oblivion"  Yeah that makes sense
Hey /r/The_Donald, I'm the leftist some of you guys put up with from time to time. I like how, through the executive order, he also signed legislation that'd stop funding for abortion in other countries. I'd love if he raised Planned Parenthood funding, proving his stance that he wants to cut US foreign aid to bring the money back HERE, and not that he's 100% against Rowe vs Wade. Meanwhile, they're spinning this as him cutting abortion funding. Smh.
Rabbit season! Duck season!
LMAO love the simple "That's stupid" btfo.  It's just so elegant in it's effectiveness.
"We're paid to oppose Trump!"
The main problem with so many people especially on the left is that they are caught in an ideological corset, but history moves forward and needs suitable answers, no egoistic, narrow-minded bullshit. A lot of them have to learn to be pragmatic.
That's my president!  Fuckin deal with it. 
The left continuing to view the war of ideas as some sort of team sport. 
It would be a shame if r all saw this.
Bernie supporter here. We're not all like that. I think what Trump did to get us the hell out of TPP is awesome. And on his first week of office too. 
As a big ol leftie, I'd just like to say that these people don't speak for us. Idiots who hate Trump cause "uhh he's like racist and bad I guess" rather than based on actual policy. I find Trump largely abhorrent but if he's doing the right thing then stand behind him. Fucking liberals.
Looking at The_Donald gives me hope because I can see so many people seeing through the globalist lies. I love you guys :)
Im a severe leftist and i would be lying if i said i  didnt wish bernie was president right now. But honestly who gives a fuck as long as ourncountry suceeds and we move in an accepting position towards all people(which trump doesnt oppose) then he will be a great president. Alot of the people on both sides of the aisle seem to think the presidential race is like a sport. If their candidate loses they have to hate on the person that won immediately. Nobody takes the time to step back and see if maybe they do bring the country towards the right direction  
The left forgot the most important rule:   never go full retard
Wow he saved the world? I WANT ANARCHY (they actually do) because WE CANNOT SUPPORT TRUMP  Seriously libs are malignant
Please tell me that a fellow 'Pede was the blue :)
I've seen some crap logic before... but this is something else.
wtf I love TPP now!
Why blank out the names?  If you say something stupid, you should be remembered for being stupid.
The acceptance stage
Hey guys, curious as to what this sub generally thinks about trumps stance on global warming? Would this be one of the things you wouldn't like too much about trump? 
While I'm not normally a fan of r/the_donald , I agree with this post 100%. If he does good things, then I'll support him.
Not a big fan of trump but I'll support this. 
Partisan chumps.
I've been strongly opposed to the majority of Trump's antics and platform from the start, but I'll be damned if I didn't feel like Trump made a serious power move today, and that as a result America came out with a win. Respect. 
TPP has always been my "at least we have this now" after trump won over hillary.
I don't support trump, but I do agree that if he makes a good decision, then it is a good decision. 
[deleted]
I'm a democrat, I voted for Bernie. But I'm gonna support this current mutha fucka when he makes good decisions. It's just stupid not to
Not all of us are like that but okay. 
I'm actually not a Trump fan, but I do agree that him backing out of the TPP was a really good call. He does have a lot of business experience.
I have a feeling that if Trump made a statement in support of getting a good nights sleep and breathing , some liberals would stay up all night holding their breath.
Fuck 2008's the Happening, this is 2017 the wakening son meme magic is in full effect.
I did not vote for trump  (didnt vote hillary either, plz dont kill me!) but I agree with him on this one as well as a few other things he has done thus far. Gotta give credit where credit is due and not just be completely aligned with one side or the other just because it's your team. 
H I V E M I N D
This was obvious irony though
You know, for as biased of a sub this is, this is a good post. Have an upvote.
I think the left might be breaking under the strain.
These liberals are so ridiculous.  Trump could cure cancer and all of a sudden liberals would love cancer.  "He cured cancer?  So now Trump is telling me I can't have cancer?  Fascist!"
Lol
Sounds as stupid as a Ken M troll lol
We CANNOT stump the Trump
If Trump gets a cat & they adore each other will they try to delete cat gifs from the internet? 
#UNAMERICAN
What subreddit was this on?
This image suggests that neither party is a trump supporter.. 2 kinds of libs, i guess.
Fuck party politics, oh and fuck TPP
you know, it would be great if people could use *critical thinking skills* to decide for *themselves* if things are good or bad, rather than following others like sheep.  people need to realize, trump is an american too: he wants america to succeed.  just because you are a democrat, doesnt mean trump wants america to fail miserably because he represents a different party.  you know who supported the TPP?  hillary clinton and obama.  who opposed it?  trump, and sanders.  this is exactly why you shouldn't generalize based on party affiliation.  not everything is black and white.
that was clearly satire lol
Does anyone else not realize that the blue user is mocking the crazy side of the left?
What the fuck. We should support whoever we agree with. If we agree with a decision, support it. Not that difficult of a concept...

The number is definitely larger.  Even if reddit does not tamper with the numbers, there are many like myself that lurked for a long time before logging into reddit once again to view my favorite sub.  SPEZ:  To more elegantly state my thoughts..  Though it has been posted many times and we all know it to be true, this quarantine by Reddit will backfire on them.  Not only will this bring new subscribers due to the Streisand effect, but it will bring many out of the shadows and many more that are curious as to just what is going on here.    The end result of all this?  The red pills will flow.

Turn every arrow orange. Every. Single. Arrow.
That Vox commentator can openly call for politicians to be milkshaked and face no social repercussions. We simply support the president and be constantly harassed. CONSERVATIVES ARE THE MOST OPPRESSED GROUP IN AMERICA. WE ARE CONSTANTLY GASLIGHTED AND SLANDERED BY THE MEDIA. Name one other group you can openly viciously  mock and demean and get away with it. Disgusting that conservatives have to advocate for basic respect even though we give more than enough respect back. Voice our opinions? Leftists make advertisers run with their tail between their legs. Run for public office? “Anti”(hint, they’re not) Fascists milkshake us. THIS IS ASSAULT. Conservatives are routinely humiliated and assaulted for their beliefs which is applauded by the left. They do this so constantly that Maxine Waters’ open call for the harassment of conservatives around America has been almost completely forgotten by the general public. Somehow, we’re the fascist, violent, Nazis. Newsflash to leftists, when you have to change the definition of concentration camps and cheapen the history behind them just to “own the cons” when all we do is make memes poking fun at you, you’re the toxic party in America, not us.
I will not be intimidated or bullied!
I'm here!
This is unbelievable. We’re experiencing censorship and we’re not protected?  Democrats get away with murder.

I don’t know what this means “refuse to run”. This sub, this media platform and this media is owned by forces that are enemies to everything you believe in. It’s not a question of choice, this sub is going away - question is not “shall I refuse to run” question is WHERE DO WE GO?
The entire establishment just came down on us. This is the horde.  Google got caught with its pants down. Silicon Valley calls reddit brass to shut down T_D to get all eyes off.  I'm not American, but it's obvious this is tyranny at work and your constitutional rights are being jizzed on by well perked and salaried corporate scum from all 4 corners of the empire.
Never running, and if they ban us, it'll only make us stronger.  Wearing my MAGA hat every DAY now!

Running away is for figs.
Feet planted. Listen, yes- we’re the fair ones, and yes- we’re also the firm ones. The censorship here is strong and is riding the line against unconstitutionality re free speech. Last I heard, it’s a stereotype to blame a group for the actions of one. We’re a peaceful, thoughtful, welcoming bunch of American loving normal dudes and chicks. Please remember that you, you reading this, are an American and that this land is your land and mine. **Peace through speech and ideas is our cornerstone.**
No brakes!

No sir. Im not going anywhere. Until such time as they destroy it completely or ban me from reddit entirely for being subbed, I wont leave. If TD goes down, Im staying till the very end.
Of course not. To do so would be heresy.
On the mobile app for me, this sub was blocked completely until about 30 minutes ago. There was  no way to choose "proceed anyway" past the hate group warning screen. It was just blocked. I could only access it from a desktop browser. When the "quarantine" went into effect and was no longer accessible via the mobile app, it was the first very real chilling effect I had encountered in a long time. It actually gave me physical chills as well if I'm being completely honest.  This group merely supports its constitutionally elected president. It makes funny memes. It points out hypocrisy. It's a community. It cuts through the media bias. It leans conservative which is great because I totally jive with a lot of the viewpoints and perspectives here. It's amazingly valuable and enjoyable. I didn't even vote for Trump as I once admitted on here, but I had been persuaded over time that he's the best man for the job. Apparently that makes me part of some evil group that needs to be destroyed and silenced. I already live in New York City where it's dangerous to voice support for him verbally. To think that reddit and tech companies also need to silence us online is absolutely terrifying.  I went on twitter immediately after discovering the quarantine to see what people were saying and it was a stream of accounts celebrating that a supposedly violent hate group was finally being taken down. It made me sick to my stomach. This sub has never been that at all.  Big Brother is real. It's really scary.
I don't know where to ask this so I'm asking here.    How do I get a flair?
> I believe that number is much higher and our real numbers are being suppressed.  It's probably something like 130 million.
I will not run.  If nominated, I will not stand.  If elected, I will have no brakes.
Ultimately this sub will be banned. All this fluff about quarantine is just the precursor to "justify" the eventual banning.  The real question is where do we go from there? Voat?
The quarantine came as a shock to me for sure. But I can't run.away because its only a matter of time before this shit gets *everybody*. So I might as well do my part and perish as a martyr, or succeed as a hero.   MAGA evolves into KAG. KAG evolves into the true Utopia with minimal conflict and maximum reward.
I’m not going anywhere and if Spez and his evil band of censors take down this DOM I will troll every fucking sub on this worthless website and call out the totalitarian, un-American behavior that has become the norm of every fucking communist, leftist loser plaguing this great country of ours.  MAGA FOREVER!!!

My family escaped the May and October communist revolutions. I prefer to stay and fight. Don't let your memes be dreams. ❤🇺🇸
Been lurking for the longest. I feel it's about time to let them know that we have the numbers this time
The upvotes are suppressed even more than the sub number.
Not going anywhere.  I did not even know this happened as I had a busy day today.  Here for the long haul.  Fuck Google and Reddit.
Just to let everyone know r conservative will be welcoming the\_donald refuges with open arms once the inevitable banning comes.
I will never run.    This sub is the only reason I am on reddit
It seems like someone from the other side posted this abusive comments deliberately on this subreddit to target it. Since all the accounts are anonymous, they are taking advantage of it to further their political agenda.
Heard you got quarantined, figured I'd drop in.  Might not vote for your guy but I'll fight for your right to party.
It's 7.5 million.  Years back it leaked that  TD was shown to be ten times as large to advertisers, but reddit doctored the numbers users see.  It would also make much more sense that a sub of 7.5 million is one of the most active subreddits
The left's fascist policy of censoring anything they don't like and arbitrarily calling us evil so as to dismiss us with hate? Won't change a single mind towards their cause. And, we're not going anywhere. This is what feelings over logic gets you. Feelings are okay, logic is okay, but without both you might as well be a robot with no practical use.
I’m not going anywhere.  Making us mad isn’t smart.
Britpede here. This sub is the only sane place on the Internet. I practically live here (although I’m a lurker). I’ve not seen calls to violence here EVER. The mods do a great job and redditers that frequent here are not filled with hate. Unlike the all the left-leaning cesspit subs...  These tech giants need a class action lawsuit or antitrust case bringing against them. They’ve gone too far. They’ve crossed a line and now they’re unashamedly meddling in the run up to the elections.  Facebook, Twitter, Google, Reddit - the whole dirty lot.
I MARCH FOR GOD EMPEROR!!!! WHOS WITH ME!!!!!
Not going anywhere! K.A.G.
Reporting for duty. Trump 2020. 🇺🇸🦅
What would it take to buy them out? ----  Seriously, is reddit a publicly traded company?  What would it take from 700,000 of us **(laughs in Centepede at that number)**, to buy a controlling interest in reddit, and boot these sorry excuses for human beings straight to the curb?!  Someone with the maths and stock market brains, please let us know.    If everyone could come up with 25 bucks to buy a share of stock, and we collectively pooled those shares, would that be enough to gain a controlling interest?  Because I, for one, have had enough of the current policy of control, manipulation, and political fuckery that the shareholders and management of reddit are putting out!    I think it is time for some good old-fashioned house cleaning at reddit HQ!
I've been on Reddit for a decade, lurked then created an account to join the T\_D.  So no, not going anywhere.  My oldest political account was on another site, had it for years. It was banned at the end of 2015 because I didn't hate Trump. There was a mass purging on many sites to stop his momentum.  That worked out well didn't it.
Can someone please tell me who SPEZ is are they the owner of reddit
I've been here since about 20k subscribers. This shit spells the end of reddit as platform and will end platform exemptions. Reddit is a publisher that censors and stifles free speech.   Reddit will not survive 2 more years before the activity and active subscribers falls to unprofitable levels. Their bots are exposed and advertises are paying attention.   Reddit is a shithole.
I am here because I refuse to bow to censorship, and because despite having some issues with Donald Trumps choices I generally like the direction he is taking the US.  &#x200B;   When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.
Fucking Reddit ... making me actually log in for this shit. Been a lurker since the beginning. This is the only subreddit I go to nowadays. TD is the only good thing Reddit has going for it and I would be happy to move over to an alternative that is more supportive to free speech.
Until they literally ban this sub, i ain't going nowhere.
Haven’t been active as much since I just read the posts and memes. But being quarantined really got me fired up. Sending support from Hawaii!  Listened to part of the democratic debate; had to turn it off since I had a meeting at work but all I can say about it is lmao
I have supported this subreddit since becoming a Bernout in August 2016. It has been a long and rewarding journey.   I've learned to look at the media with a more critical eye since then (thanks, NoAgenda podcast), and have learned to appreciate the idea of questioning everything. I see nothing wrong with supporting our president Trump and protecting the welfare of American citizens and the Constitution.   I'm not religious but I will say it still: God bless our president and the United States of America. Embrace your inalienable rights and work hard everyday.
If it does get shut down completely, where is the next best place to go? I like the Donald because it's a catch all for news and information
Surprised it took them this long to make a serious move on this forum. But loosers always try to silence the opposition
If this is banned where do we go next?
I am a long time lurker on this sub and have never actually posted. I like to browse through for a good laugh or two before I go to bed. I have never once seen a post that suggested violence towards the police here.   I joined and left this first comment today. I don’t think that it’ll make a difference in the fate of the sub, but maybe I can be a grain of sand that helps to make a heap. Censorship is getting out of hand.
Who wants to be that this "comments" that got us quarantined are either fake or from leftists?
They have been looking for a reason to shut down The\_donald for a long time they probably blame TD for helping Trump win in 2016 and they want it shut down because of it.  It's sad the people posting violence probably were paid DNC operatives and they reported the abusive comments to shut us down.  Sick.    Google, FaceBook, Twitter and Youtube are working hand in glove to suppress the engagement of our community to silence those that support our President.  Sick.
This is bullshit - just deleted my reddit app cause I couldn’t get here through it
Been a lurker since nearly the start of this subreddit and finally created an account 2 years ago even though I still mostly lurk. I’m not going anywhere.
This is the first step before reddit outright bans T_D  Members of this sub have been talking about a contingency plan in case we are banned. Perhaps a new sub can be made?
Why does it seem like all of the larger communication/social media and corporate industries are run by lefties?  How the fuck did they get into positions of such power since they supposedly abhor capitalism and control??  (yeah, that may be a bit rhetorical)
Cant silence us, we will flood the rest of the subs before we go
Remember, China owns Reddit now. They are one of the biggest donors to this platform and censorship will be the norm.
I only joined Reddit to participate in T_D because this is just about the only place on the internet that supports our president.

Leftists should stop calling themselves "Liberals".  There's nothing "liberal" about them anymore.
This is what you get when the government guarantees loans for anyone and everyone to go to college, regardless of whether they can actually handle it.  College is supposed to be hard.  It's supposed to challenge everything you believe.  And you're supposed to grow because of it.  Instead, many colleges are now glorified day care.
It's not a meritocracy anymore. Admission is geared towards political aims.
Proof that people are correct when they say leftists have taken over educational institutions and are using them to indoctrinate the youth. This shows they view other opinions as a threat to the power they now hold.
I'm a Republican Berkeley Law student AMA
It's partly a cultural issue.  Our school systems are loaded with marxist ideology, our children are taught that everyone get's a trophy, that they are all special snowflakes, that the country owes them, that our country is chock full of racism and bigotry and that college is there to serve them.  Many have the attitude that the world revolves around them - they will be totally unprepared to deal with real life when and if they graduate, unless their career is in academia which then simply perpetuates the problem.  I fear for the future of our country.

Cultural Marxism in action
They were brainwashed by marxists professors.  99% of all faculties are super extreme left wing.
\#snowflake
Buncha fucking drooling idiot brain washed kids.
Marxism is a hell of a drug 
A group of students at UC Berkeley spit on one of my US Army Recruiters in 2015. The recruiters were not on campus (they are not allowed), but were at a nearby restaurant speaking with some students. Completely unprovoked, a group of four approached the recruiter, called him a murderer and a baby killer, berated the student he was talking to, and spit in his face.   The two time war veteran grabbed his belongings and left the restaurant without further incident. My recruiters stay away from that school now.   "Safe Space" and "Free Speech" only qualify if you agree with their ideas. I have lost all respect for that institution. 
I guess these are the people who gave up studying.
This is kind of misleading. Berkeley has been full of extremists for a long time. That 1964 pic is probably the most tame pic ever taken there. 
We're a generation away from Ivy league schools being permanent cuck breeding grounds.
Berkeley was always an extremist shithole.   I went there for undergrad. 
This is what years and years of coddling kids looks like.
The communist Left only wants "tolerance" and "free speech" in order to allow THEIR views to be heard.  Once they are in control and have power, they move to silence their opposition.  
I am an aging ex-leftist, raised marxist, turned Trump supporter.  My father has followed the same path, but he is still pretty hard left.  We are both shocked by the lack of character, integrity, and quality of discourse, in today's liberals.  They are seemingly incapable of objective debate, they oppose open dialogue, and they jump immediately to violent rioting.  Sad.
I graduated Berkeley in 2005, and it makes me incredibly sad to see the direction that it has gone. Being a liberal used to mean that I had a strong academic focus while exploring psychedelics and alternative explanations,  it did not mean complaining all day and expecting others to fix my problems. 
"Your free speech ends where my feelings begin"
This is a powerful statement, but...  BerkEley (sp)   
I think it was Milo who made a great point on this.  The "Activists" at top universities tend to be the dregs; the truly talented and smart people get on with their studies. Meanwhile these pretentious SJWs realise that they are totally out of their depth; they're not special anymore, they're not even average among their peers... so they resort to activist bullshit like this in order to justify their existence.  I'm just glad that here in the UK these people aren't quite so outspoken... at least not at my university. Then again as a PhD student maybe I'm out of the loop on what these young whipper snappers get up to.  I just checked, apparently my uni has a "safe space". Well hopefully they will stay there.
Back in the 90s, when I was in college, saying "this classroom is a safe space" meant that it was "safe" to discuss all ideas/theories/opinions and that one could not be subject to ad hominen attacks or ridiculed for expressing a contrary view
Most university students nowadays arent actually intelligent they are just educated, and there is a big difference between those two things.
the new left is retarded...these idiots don't know how out of touch they are with the concerns of working people...
Nasty ideology !!!  They stink of hypocrisy
Dumb fuck liberal cucks
Berkeley has been full of some of the dumbest, most liberal, passive aggressive libtards for years 
60 years controlling education with no conservative voice will do that
I disagree with a lot of what you all post here...but when your right your right. 
Being educated and being smart are two different things.
The left change how rights work now. Your rights end where theirs begin.
Fuck. I am seriously depressed right now.
Berkeley*?
The smart people left
fucking pathetic
This generation of liberals are a bunch of pussies known as snowflakes. 
I no longer see colleges as a place for intelligent discourse, now it's just extended high-school, where the bullies get their way by pretending to be victims. 
Have my upvote... I really don't like this sub in general, but I can't argue with anti-SJW memes. Modern SJWs are pathetic.
It's what happens when parents protect their kids from life. Which they did in turn because of the fear mongering bullshit from the media. Which they did to please their corporate overlords. 
Universities were never fucking meant to be safe spaces. Nothing about learning or higher education should be safe or comfortable. You're SUPPOSED to have your ideas and worldview challenged by professors, peers, and books.   If your university is a safe space it's a fucking daycare and nothing more.   
[deleted]
Yeah these current Berkeley students need to be told "That's not how this works."  Just because at one point people who went there spoke up and had a meaningful protest does not mean that your opinion counts by riding on their coattails.  Especially when your message is the exact opposite of what they fought for. 
Okay, let's say you go to a doctor because you are afraid of being outside, socialize or you are just terribly afraid of spiders, birds, whatever.  What does that doctor do to you?   Does he simply lock you up in a little safe space room for the rest of your life?   OR will he he make sure that you confront your fears to help you with your problem?

"This is not a debate" The fascist guide on how to shut down people with different opinions.
You can lead a student to college, but you can not make them think.
Now it is the #donaldtrump supporters who are the smart ones. Liberalism will burn in hell under Trump, as it should! 
true liberals would upvote this. the diversity of thought in universities has all but disappeared
when you've become so far left that you are literally communist
Pathetic Marxist university culture, if possible i would avoid any school on the west coast 
It's because school districts and college and universities are invaded by Marxist teachers and professors, they are all about is sentimentalism instead of practicality. They live in a fairy world mindset. And they pass it on to the students, where everyone is a winner, where descent on progressiveness is not tolerated.  Zero Tolerance was a mistake. Common core was a mistake. Race quotas are a mistake.   Tax payer money shouldn't be wasted on liberal arts degrees. Tax payer money should promote doctors, STEM scientists, lawyers, engineers, programmers, officers. Not ethnic studies or women studies. 
That is damn heartbreaking. 
The biggest victory of the left is making the people believe that "degree equals intelligence". Even worse if there's no differentiation between the field in which the degree was obtained. You can't compare STEM field degree to "gender studies" degree. Academia is going downhill really fast, and its especially true the bigger the government involvement in it. 
I wish I had protesters like this at my University.   How easy would it be to troll someone holding a sign that says "THIS IS NOT A DEBATE..."
"safe space" essentially translates to "dont criticize me, even if im wrong".  any intelligent person should be willing to debate a topic.  and admit they are wrong if they are OBJECTIVELY wrong, via evidence.  you cant just sit in a circle on campus and say for example "all cops are bad!"...then I could show these people evidence that cops save lives and protect people, making them wrong.  objectively!  see, the idea that "cops are all killers" is toxic nonsense that spreads in safe spaces like these.  it's ignorance.  cops put their lives on the line for us, and they dont care.  but they wont listen.  because they only want to listen to their interpretation of reality, in a "safe space".  even if you said "hey, my dad is a cop, and he helps people!"...they will just throw a tantrum and go back to their false reality.  because they want their bubble to stay a bubble, and not get popped with logic, or common sense.
Which loser invented the idea of the safe space?   God Nov 8 must have been a meltdown day for them. Delicious.
It's really sad these are grown ass adults
Fuck Berkeley, it's nothing but a commie clown collage. Even in the sixties they were Marxist trash.
Coats and ties and angry, blue-haired, Swiss cheese-faced bums. Sad!
Great post. I wish all the snowflakes could see this maybe they would wake up and stop drinking the kool aid.
Free speech is an easy thing to take for granted.
Safe spaces, trigger warnings, and micro-aggression are the weakest things to come out of this generation. Luckily [The University of Chicago](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-university-of-chicago-safe-spaces-letter-met-20160825-story.html) still has balls and free discourse. 
FREE SPEECH (until it hurts my feelings or I disagree with it or you're a white male)
Rip intelligent thought you will be missed. 
Everyday our pool of 'smart' people keeps getting closer to looking like a puddle https://sli.mg/z6asKn
The one on the right, to me, is much more dangerous. A safe space isn't always bad. Like drug or alcohol or abuse support groups. Or a therapists office.  The issue is discussion is ***always*** a good thing. Im a right wing conservative, and you know what? I surround myself with people with a lot of different opinions. I know some very intelligent people on the left and i love listening to them, because they have a lot of good points and bring a lot to the table.  But the moment you try and stifle discussion is the moment you lose credibility.
Berkeley*
Lmfao.... this is not a debate. Wtf. Who are you..... SIT DOWN. 
I call bullshit at the concept of safe spaces because they don't allow every group/ideology to have one. These leftist-controlled universities don't allow whites, males, conservatives, christians, etc. to have safe spaces.   It's all about shutting down the debate and protecting their way of thought from criticism.
To all the people trying to compare a university space to a subreddit: lol
[deleted]
One of the reasons why I crossed Berkeley off my lists of colleges.
[removed]
I'm from a family of immigrants.  This what happens when "universities" accept students based on color of skin/ethnicity, instead of grades/scores, etc.
The smart peeps all graduated and voted Trump.
Berkeley*
If you're going to post about people not being "smart," at least know how to spell their university.  Berkeley.
You make a good point here because college should be a place to exchange ideas, but I also think context is important. Where is the second picture from in this image? I would also like to point out that making blanket statements about how college educated "smart" people are tumblrinas who cannot take criticism is a lot like how anti-trumps try to call trump supporters racist. Lets not perpetuate either of those stereotypes.   
The real piss off is that the IDEA of a "safe space" is great (that minorities, LGBT, etc. should not have to deal with discrimination at schools because NOBODY should have to deal with that) but in practice it has been awful.  You can't scream SAFE SPACE and then tell me to "check my white privilege" or whatever bullshit you spew next.    
Part of me is sad that I never made it to an Ivy League school.   Then part of me is thankful I never had to deal with this shit.
It's what happens when you replace intellectuals with gender studies students.
[removed]
Generally it has been my experience that the idle who scream the loudest about something given the chance become the worst example of what they claim to hate. Have an open mind means dump what you believe and adopt uncritically what I am telling you to believe. Freedom of speech is freedom to tell you what you should believe and freedom to silence you as soon as possible. Give peace a chance seems to result in the worst sort of wars. Nobody should boycott the Dixie Chicks for the things they say, boycott Mel Gibson for the things he says. It isn't hypocrisy it's mental illness. 
With the middle class eroded we now see the stark division of those who have and those who have not. The liberal elitist mind set is to silence those who threaten their wealth and status by demanding a seat at the table. Their self serving rhetoric is breathtaking. Any threat to their ideology results in insults and abuse and a further calls to limit and deny free speech as well as to promote propaganda.   
CIA, FBI, and NSA are having a huge laugh right now. COINTELPRO sure did a number on us.
Marxism needs an infantilized population. It's really an attack on these kids. 
People who loves America versus people who don't
drives me crazy when people make their controversial opinions public & then claim oppression / patriarchy when challenged... Some of them will even say stupid shit like "this is not a debate."   Wtf ppl, if ur gonna say shit in public people are going to respond...
LOSERS
My company is bidding on some work with the city of Berkeley, you should see the mountain of SJW related agreements you have to sign to do business with that town. I've never seen anything like it.
The rabid Left can't win on ideas!  Once they have power they will attempt to stomp all dissent.  
They progressed themselves right off a cliff.

Hillary Clinton passes the fuck out and gets chucked into a van like a side of beef -- Wouldn't it be a shame if this reached r/all on election day? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Thank you, for your diligence on reminding us Hillary Clinton passed the fuck out and got chucked into a van like a side of beef.    Good work, soldier.  I would nominate you for a medal, if I could.
**Hillary Clinton had a "medical episode" at the 15th anniversary ceremony of 9/11:** http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/11/hillary-clinton-has-medical-episode-at-911-ceremony-source-says.html  There are multiple **Videos** of the event:  - YouTube (original high-def): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zYthqiLs_I - YouTube (alternate): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpz9S4HtHic - Gfy (color-corrected): https://gfycat.com/DefiantSpotlessIndianpangolin - Gifv (color-corrected): http://i.imgur.com/xr5UbvJ.gifv  **Background.**  Hillary Clinton has a serious medical condition, most likely **Parkinson's disease.** This is evident in her inability to climb stairs unassisted, her persistent cough, her bizarre eye movements, and more than one public seizure-like episode.  At one time, Hillary's aides were researching **Parkinson's medication.** http://dailycaller.com/2016/08/23/emails-top-hillary-aide-was-researching-drug-that-treats-parkinsons-alzheimers/  According to her closest aide, she is **"often confused."** http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/hillary-clinton/11999840/Hillary-Clinton-often-confused-according-to-senior-aide.html  Hillary suffered a **concussion** in 2012. http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/15/us/us-hillary-clinton-concussion/index.html  **Q. What is the thing that falls at her feet?**  **A.** The best explanation I've seen is that the Secret Service gave her something to hold that would make a lot of noise if she dropped it (like a set of keys). That way, they know the exact moment when she loses consciousness and it's time to throw her in the van like a side of beef.  Notice that as soon as the object hits the ground, all the SS agents close in and block the view of the van. They've trained for this moment. Hillary passing out is nothing new to them.  **Q. But it fell out of her pant-leg!**  **A.** Yeah... It could be part of an ostomy bag (a medical device that holds waste, such as urine), specifically the pin that straps the bag to a person's thigh. As others have noted, Hillary wears very baggy clothing, and she appears to be concealing a medical device on her leg (see https://i.sli.mg/3a0zLV.png). Others have suggested a leg brace.  **Q. Like a side of beef?**  **A.** Actual quote from the NYPD. "Clinton was thrown in a van ‘like she was a side of beef,’ a law enforcement official said..." http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/11/reports-hillary-leaves-ground-zero-ceremony.html  **Q. This was just a one-time thing, though, right?**  **A.** Not according to Bill Clinton, who said that this has happened "frequently." He then walked back his statement, saying that it had happened "on more than one occasion." http://freebeacon.com/politics/cbs-edits-frequently-bill-clintons-remarks-hillary-fainting/  Once again, I'll draw your attention to the Secret Service agents and the fact that Hillary was never taken to a hospital. If this was a new medical event in Hillary's life, her team would have rushed her straight to the hospital. But they didn't. They took her to Chelsea's apartment instead. Why? Because this was nothing new for Hillary's campaign. They already have a diagnosis (likely Parkinson's), and they know how to deal with it.

Hey remember that time on 9/11 when Hillary Clinton got chucked into her van like a SIDE OF BEEF and then lied about it to everyone?  Remember that staged little girl running up to her? That was so much fun.
#Hey everyone I know people here are pro-Trump, but politics aside it's clear from this video that Hillary is very very SICK and WEAK!! Regardless of whether she has the physical stamina to do the job or not, let's all hope and pray that she can get herself healthy again. Thankfully, she will have plenty of time to rest after today. Get your strength back up Hillary, when this is all over we want you to be able to serve your full sentence!!!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_(disease) Kuru is a type of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, caused by prions, which cause abnormal folding of specific proteins mostly found in the brain.

LOOK AT HER FEET DRAGGING!
I think she was passed out that entire time. Looks like she's being propped up on the bollard. Plus the guy in the grey suit that goes to get her looks totally unfazed the entire time. He never goes, "oh shit right now? OK I guess this is happening".
"She's like a side of beef, that one." --Detective Andy Sipowicz, NYPD
Not only is she a shell of a former human being, her shell is dying. Please, no empty placeholder president. Go Trump!
That's what happens when your handler doesn't bring enough flies to get your reptilian ass through the day.
she's weak, her bloodline is weak, and she wont survive the election 
Hahaha top of r/all!! I'm so tired of winning (not tired) and can't wait to see the results!
Hey CTR.... wanna buy some memes?

#SIDE OF FUCKING BEEF!
What dropped down her leg, seriously.
WEW SPICY NO BREAKS 
So when John McCain has medical problems the media bangs on about it constantly, but when Hillary has them and possible mental problems we hear nothing from the media. Thanks for reminding us of this.
#SIDE OF BEEF BTFO

I have an honest question. Is there an election silence in USA?
Thats going to happen tonight when she loses.

Good thing Trump will never  have this problem. He's like Christopher Reeve sucking the blood of unborn fetuses. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNJi0CzfodI 
ahh one last time  and still as funny as the first day I saw it
Has Hilldawg sobered up from last night's video ? 
55% and 7740 updonalds.  It seems that CTR can't keep up with the  #TRUMP TRAIN!  \#MAGA
I'm really digging the color correction here, i always had a hard time before seeing the full extent of her utter helplessness
Can we get a pinned submission on her stumbling off the plane. Sort of a running update on booze gate ?
It would be so kool if she has another dizzy tissy. No matter what Hill does she goes to the Afterlife 6 months after inauguration. Trump 16.
Total disaster 
Yup, still up-voting this sucker.  Top Kek!!
Ghost of 911 bengazi past coming back to haunt.  
#sideofbeef for favorite meme 2016
its easty to make fun of this but what was actually wrong with her?
Ive seen this side of beef post every day for 2 months. Still funny
We did it Reddit!

Let her cast her vote from under the van!

I'm so fucking glad Trump won.

Why are we tolerating this.  These people *need* to be shut the fuck down.
And these are the ones preaching concepts of "love each other" & "tolerate the opinions of others". They claim to be patriotic but we have videos of them burning the American flag while waving the Soviet flag & the Mexican flag?   Disgusting hypocrites.

This is all the medias fault. They fucking did this by constantly race baiting. They fucking did this by scaring the shit out of half the country by lying about awful things that trump is going to do to minorities when none of it is true. They need to stop with their hateful rhetoric because they are just dividing this country more and more. 
The racists are blacks now. Against non-blacks and against themselves. 
This is on you MSM. Including you Reddit. Absolutely disgusting.

This just saddens me. You can be sad, you can be angry about the election but when you do this you just reveal yourself as an animal and someone who does not have personal ethical cause to be angry at the election results because your own problems extend far beyond political opinion

Reddit CEO Admits Changing Comments to Direct Users' Insults at Pro-Trump Moderators
[deleted]
[deleted]
You understand the gravity of the massive fireball you just put out there, correct? You have lost the trust of (at least) thousands of users of this website. You have literally, in that petty act, destroyed the credibility of Reddit. Any article that quotes a user post, uncredible. For all people know here, we are all now in danger of the admins throwing child porn into one of our histories, and endangering us. This was a massive mistake. This is your career, and you put your emotions into making this massive mistake.
To the top, please. /u/spez should resign immediately. For christ's sake, Ellen Pao was removed for deleting a subreddit that hated fat people. This guy is using his position as a leader in the reddit org as a tool to advance his political agenda. We need to demand a resignation from him and ensure the investors know an unbiased and experienced CEO is put in his place  Edit: Notice I made sure the edit notification was the prefix --  I am appalled that someone who runs a social media site and prides themselves on democracy through upvotes continues to subjugate the will of the people.  If this got attention of the folks who provide the content for people like /r/news and /r/politics... or even the people at /r/bloomberg, it would certainly create an outrage large enough to be covered in the MSM.  Once we get there, the investors might actually hear about it.  Edit 2:  Note when you see this page the poster above me takes a more happenstance approach.  It's far easier to brush his comment off.  Hold these guys accountable.  This is no joke.  This is what CTR or Soro's infiltration looks like at its finest.
He made anything posted on this site inadmissible in court. Everything. Any defense attorney could argue that it might have been edited by admins. The credibility of this website is dead. Great CEO we have here. 
Let's not forget /u/Mannoslimmins who has gone on a deletion / banning spree - in addition to trying to hush up the evidence he called for someone to commit suicide.  That deserves removal of all privs on the site.
2016: the year where conspiracy theory became conspiracy fact. 
Reddit is done. No coming back from this. What are they going to do? Promise not to do it again? Swear this is the first and only time? Fuck that. Admins cannot be trusted.
Like... holy shit. /u/spez came into my room to bring me a plate of edited posts and I literally screamed at him and hit the plate of posts right out of his hand. He started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on him. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to /u/spez but I'm literally in shock from what happened tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck did he edit those posts? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a reddit to believe in. I want/u/spez to be CEO and fix this broken website. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was a good CEO???? This is so fucked.

Full transcript of the talks here, in easily digestible images:  https://sli.mg/a/is2ZP7
And as usual, Breitbart's is the one article that gets most things right.      Try reading the BBC one or the Indipendent... they managed to turn even this piece of internet news into propaganda, it's unbelievable. 
#THE TOLERANT LEFT IS SHOWING IT'S TRUE COLORS!
#/r/The_Donald:  When /u/spez talks about apology, We think the one he should really be apologizing for and the thing that he should be apologizing for are the 33,000 comments that he edited. And then the two subreddits of child trafficking investigations and other things this week that were taken from the website and are now missing. And we’ll tell you what. We didn’t think we’d say this but we’re going to say it and we hate to say it, but if we win, we are going to instruct our new CEO to get a special administrator to look into his situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception, there has never been anything like it. And we’re going to have a special administrator. When we shitpost, we go out and shitpost, the users of this domreddit are furious. In our opinion, the people that have been long term users of this website are furious. There has never been anything like this where comments, and you get called a cuck. You get called a cuck and after getting called a cuck you edit 33,000 comments and then you censor them, or [removed] them, as you would say, a very expensive process so we’re going to get a special administrator and we’re going to look into it because you know what? People have been, their accounts have been banned for doing one fifth of what he’s done. And it’s a disgrace and honestly he ought to be ashamed of himself.  #“Power Mods”:  /u/spez I want to follow up on that I’m going to let you talk about comments.  #/u/spez:  Let me just quickly say everything they just said is absolutely false but I’m not surprised. #/r/The_Donald:  Oh really. #/u/spez:  In the first algorithm change, in the first algorithm change… #”Power Mods”:  We really, the user base needs to calm down here. #/u/spez:  I told people that it would be impossible to be suppressing /r/The_Donald all the time I’d never get to talk about anything I want to do or how we’re going to really uh make the site better for people. So, once again, go to www.reddit.com we have /r/[redacted], you can brigad, bridgade, brigade them in real time. Last time at the first algorithm change we had thousands of people uh brigading so I expect we’ll have thousands more brigading, uh, because you know, it is, uh, it’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of /r/The_Donald is not in charge of the rules on our website. #/r/The_Donald: #Yeah, because you’d be banned. 
Isn't it funny how it's always the Left censoring the Right?

Get him outta here..OUT OUT OUT!  Even then though, it calls everything on this site into question. If they have the power to do this, god only knows what else they could change in the future or what they have changed already!
Well this came from Breitbart so it's obvious fake news, so this censorship never happened. /s
SPEWIN SPEZ bans /r/pizzagate but he's cool with /r/pedofriends?  **WHAT ARE THIS MAN'S PRIORITIES???***
You know shit's getting real when the MSM and Brietbart are reporting the same story.   Edit: /u/Spez is a bigger faggot than Moot ever was. And that's saying something. 
Hey, not sure if anybody has mentioned yet, but fuck you /u/spez
How is this not on the front page? This calls into question the validity of every comment from here on out. 
Hey fuck /u/spez
/u/spez realises than anyone accused of a crime with redsit posts as evidence, like stonetear,  can now reasonably dump the blame on him, right? /u/spez for prison!
u/spez is a loser.  Such low energy, he couldn't take the pressure, he just choked, choked just like a dog!  
[deleted]
Why does /u/spez hate America?
u/spez ? Never heard of her 
This issue today really calls into spotlight issues from the past. Remember the suspicious changes which only effected this sub? Remember the messed up algorithm which, again, only effected this sub?  This has been going on for a long time now and, frankly, I would bet it has been going on in worse ways than we even see here. For example, profile/email and identity scanning.   Google was recently nailed for doing just that that I wouldn't at all be surprised if Reddit did the same.
Hello!  Disclaimer: This user cannot verify whether or not this comment has been edited by /u/spez
 Hey /u/The_Magic_Stick,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
I thought we were just a bunch of bots? 
For the people saying he should step down, I don't think that's enough if reddit wants to keep their credibility intact. I think they'd have to modify their database software so that if such an edit ever happened again, it would be reflected as a mod/admin edit, instead of it being a silent change.
God they shaved off 3000+ votes off this post
calling for /u/spez to go fuck himself  also resign
Grounds for firing. Resignation is the right thing. Trust is a very important attribute for a leader.  Saying you are sorry is pitiful as a leader for this circumstance.  
[deleted]
Oh no, that publication actually gets good traffic. Now everyone will know :^)
I would be surprised if anything genuinely negative happens to Spez.  He probably was granted permission to do so and wanted it.   Shutoff Pizzagate and fuck with the_donald sub to show who's really in charge before he goes.  He already has another even better job already lined up.  This is just a transition to the new team and we'll all hope the new CEO is on our side (they won't be). Spez will shut down the_donald, resign and we will all celebrate as if we won.  He's just going out with a bang while we all get played for fools.  Then the next person comes in, "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss".  The new CEO will be even further left.  Reddit for Trump supporters is ending.

Fascist gonna fascist.
A libtard can't stand being falsely accused and name called repeatedly?  What a fucking surprise. Next time consider treating others like you want yourself to be treated.   Next to zero chance any libtard especially such a huge douchebag like Spez have any self awareness at all.
How very adult of him.  It's great how the leftists fight a world of hatred and bigotry that they actually create themselves.  It's almost as if they know they are full of shit and instead of just calming down and being reasonable, they fling shit everywhere.

Fuck /u/spez
Just imagine if Donald Trump had a Reddit account. /u/spez can simply stealth edit his comment and ruin his presidency. His 'an hour of trolling' is basically a warning to every reddit that he has the ability to ruin anyone.
tfw when a breitbart article is #1 on the front page
I said fuck it to Facebook, then I said fuck it to Twitter, now finally, and probably for the good, fuck it to Reddit. I'm done with social media. 
/u/spez needs to step down immediately and not hire another chinese woman to ass blast this site.
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 
This just gets worse and worse.
I was just wondering when breitbart would cover this story.

Serious question, what is Breitbart compared fox, I'm trying to decide what the best news source to use is. I'm gonna use more than one to get the most accurate obviously but for first checking, which?
He has a face you really want to punch 
Here's Neogaf talking about it.   http://m.neogaf.com/showthread.php?t=1319351  They all believe the CEO was right to change the posts and would love this sub to be deleted.   Assholes
Toppest of keks. Reddit is gonna go under any day now under the weight of its own hypocrisy. 
And don't forget! Leftist will be at your Thanksgiving diner. Perhaps /u/spez will be here,  editing your words! BE CAREFUL! Record when you say "FUCK /u/spez". DON'T LET AN ADMIN CONFUSE YOU!
The Cuck in Chief will have to step down. I'm thankful to see some of  those that don't agree with the ideology of this sub side with us on this issue.
That.... ladies and gentlemen, is the face of a cuck

Flint, MI: Water Crisis getting real traction from Trump Supporters, pushing the issue to the top! We can't be ignored !!
#guys.  The issue was the PH difference from the detroit to flint water.  All that had to happen was water hardener would have had to be added.  The guy who was appointed (yes appointed) didn't add it.  And caused this mess.  Edit More specifics for ctr shills: The Flint water crisis is an ongoing drinking water contamination issue in Flint, Michigan, United States, that started in April 2014. After Flint changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water (which was sourced from Lake Huron as well as the Detroit River) to the Flint River (to which officials had failed to apply corrosion inhibitors), its drinking water had a series of problems that culminated with lead contamination
Yesterday I posted this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ptorl/flint_michigan_lets_use_our_high_energy_to_get/?st=IYBPA0KG&sh=3ee5264a  From 10PM to 6AM it gained enough traction to be the top post in r/All. This is gaining real traction. Memes are being posted. Leftists are chiming in with additional support.  The_Donald has the highest energy. Trump's supporters have the best discussions. We need to press on the issues we care about, to unify our citizens, and help those in need.  No one can say this is a bad thing. The MSM can't demonize him or us for this. If Trump, no, if WE are going to Make America Great Again, there is absolutely no better place to start than Flint, Michigan.  I'm hoping this post spurs real conversation about what is causing the problem, and possible ways to fix it. We have the best steamfitters, the best plumbers, the greatest civil engineers, and the most amazing Americans.   Lets get to work, 'pedes and cucks together at last!!
I decided that, even though I voted Clinton, I would nevertheless remain fair: praising Trump for good decisions and criticizing for poor ones.   This is a good idea and I hope that Flint and other places can get the help they need.

All of this is a result of local malfeasance.  This is a State issue and the people in Michigan have to hold the politicians who let them down accountable.    
Fix flint
As a liberal this would be checkmark #2 from me, #1 being the TPP rejection
Why did Obama send a quarter billion dollars to Palestinians last week when that could have been significant in the repairing of the crisis in Flint?
I'm a dirty liberal socialist who isn't going to agree with most of Trump's or your all's ideals. However, if I do agree with something I'm not going to ignore supporting it just Bc it's a Trump idea. There are often common denominators and middle grounds. I support fixing the Flint water crisis, 100%. Have my upvote.
Imagine the butthurt when a Republican fixes it 
DT...do this thing right here.
Los Angeles Pedes, checking in. Donald should do it. Fix this shit. Declare a national emergency over it like Obama declared one over Podesta's gmail. C'mon. 
We need a gofundme to be stickied by the admins so that we can raise money. If everyone in this sub put up 5$ it would be $1,750,000
Outsider here, glad you all are discussing this issue. It's sad no previous president, including Obama, did anything to fix Flint.  Genuine question, how do you feel about the President signing off on the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines today? Wouldn't these projects create potentially more Flint-like issues? And aren't the jobs he proposed these projects will create only temporary?
**Can we get back the [$221,000,000](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/24/us-quietly-sent-221m-to-palestinians-in-obamas-last-hours.html) that Obama gave to terrorists before he slithered out of office, and instead put towards the Flint Water Crisis???**   Funny, Trump says "America First", while Obama was Cleary "Fuck Americans, and fund terrorists"
Oh my goodness, never thought the day would come where I would upvote a T_D post on /r/all.  Keep up the good work and keep supporting Americans who need more energy!
It's sad people actually down vote this.
I have been thinking about this lately. wouldnt it send a powerful message if across the country groups of Trump supporters dressed and trump gear hats shirts etc. were out in the inner cities and poorer areas helping with cleaning up, helping out running shelters, tutoring students.... the Democrats would have nothing to say about that. And  it would totally drive them crazy. 
Just heard it on the news. State of MI is now saying the water in flint is ok. What? 
What's the best way to fix this? Would this require replacing all of the pipes in all of the homes? Do the main veins need to be replaced? Does it have to do with the treatment?  Feels like this should be someone's responsibility. What's the point of having all of this government if they can't even clean our water. 
Who the fuck makes a water pipe out of lead?
Not a fan a trump, but there's nothing wrong with supporting a good cause no matter who it came from. 
It's unacceptable that lead solder is still used in some pipes
This is why I voted for Trump. If ANYONE can assemble a team of people to get this fixed on time and under budget, it is him. I'm sure he is paying attention.  My father supervised a wastewater treatment facility for many years. They added potassium permanganate to the water and he calculated the amounts needed. I remember the purple color when I went to visit him at work. He cared about his job. Where were the damn supervisors in Flint???
Over 21K, at 67% upvoted.  Who the fuck downvotes fixing the water in Flint.  You libshits are fucking disgusting.
Obama wouldn't step in because he wants to turn the friggin frogs gay. Sad!   Ben Carson alone can heal this water. 
Not sure if any of you centipedes were around for the very beginning of dogecoin. How they sent that guy to the Olympics and raised money for good causes. Everybody was tipping everybody's comments real money was flowing. I saw a guy tip somebody $1000. It was crazy but he didn't mind. Because that money returned to him in spades from other users tipping him back. It was this positive feedback loop.   Well this community is and feels exactly like how that felt. You guys have something very special here. Use it for good.
This is gaining traction because I just heard 760am Detroit say Flints water is now at 12 parts per million below the dangerous threshold of 15 parts per million for lead. They are trying to say that everything is fine before Trump helps Flint.
This is EXACTLY what The_Donald should be doing! Don't just fawn over the man, push him in the right direction with your high energy memes! This community has accomplished MIRACULOUS things!
It needs to get to the Trump People
Come on flint, let's make your water great again!
They haven't fixed the problem yet?  Cripes, let's get to it then.
MAKE FLINT GREAT AGAIN MR PRESIDENT AND WE WILL WIN THERE FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS! WE CAN DO THIS PEDES DO NOT GIVE UP MAKE IT HAPPEN!
Seriously, how can liberals talk about bringing more people in if we can't even take care of our own?  #AMERICA FIRST
Thank you everyone for getting this issue to the top of reddit, it needs to be seen, again..  And acted on.
I didn't vote Trump and I approve this message. 
What kind of treasonous, bitter spiteful cunt do you have to be to not want Americans to have clean drinking water under President Trump?  If your liberal lunacy has got to this point, you should probably do the world a favour and KYS.
Instead of sending $$ to Palestine, take some of that and fix what should be declared an emergency in Flint.   #PROTECT THE TAXPAYER
Might be the only thing on this sub I've ever upvoted. This, I would hope, is something that all Americans can agree on.
Pedes! Don't bash the dems. Lets get this done. Lets put the pollitics in the rear view mirror. EVERYONE knows what happened. Not enough people know what's going on, and that is a huge problem. Lets not let Americans fucking die of lead poisoning!
My plan to fix Flint:   * Get rid of prevailing wage laws in that area. It raises the cost of construction preventing the already poor city from getting real value for their money. No reason to be paying a plumber $65/hr in a city with +10% unemployment rate. That's insane.  * Get rid of MBE/WBE requirements from city and state contracts. It artificially raises the cost of construction. Flint cant afford corrupt liberal handout programs.  * Get rid of the other dumb barriers to entry and regulation crap for things as basic as trade skills. This is a really long list of stuff.   * Gut the dumb-ass government pension plans that put the city in debt in the first place. You cant fix anything if you are in permanent crippling debt because you made promises you knew you wouldn't be able to keep and KEEP DOING SO. Make them go to 401K plans like everyone else in the modern economy. Make the city fix manpower costs as they happen and dont let them build up as ballooning debt for decades and decades.  * Train and the locals. Seriously. Just put shop class back in the high schools with a semester in plumbing. Teach people to not be helpless.  * Bulldoze the blight. Fast track the demolition of blighted areas. Bring them down to the ground and quit paying for them.  * Put Americans to work. Higher locally and start digging. 
or we need to get it to Tucker or Hannity or Other media types
How do we get this in front of him? If he saw what was happening I know he would help in any way legally possible. (or maybe some with his own money) 
People go through huge lengths to make their home have safe piping for water. I know copper and pex are common but It's useless if the lines feeding those lines contain lead. Gotta start at the source. We need to fix this.
This should be the first infrastructure project. There has to be a trustworthy contractor or group of contractors that can fix that water situation. Apparently the local gov can't do it (or won't do it).  They say Baton Rouge has the cleanest water, best tasting water, in the country - put those Louisiana baws to work.
It used to be cars were made in Michigan and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico.  Now cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Michigan.
We must do this for the people and for pat Patterson the man who fought for decades to get the neurotoxin lead out of our food, water, gas and many other things
Fuck yes! Awesome to see you pedes using that high energy to get this some attention!
Surely fixing this issue would require jobs? Jobs that Trump is very much in favor of creating?   If Trump fixed the lead issue the libs would literally implode. 
if Trump gets this fixed in less than a year I would be so happy. It would show the sack full of crap Obama was.
Liberals whine and republicans get to work. 
My father is the superintendent at the water plant in the next town over from mine and he said Basically what happened was Flint "tried to start a car that's been sitting on the lawn for years and drive it cross-country"
I sit on the left usually and I'm not a huge trump supporter, but it's really good to see that we can all agree that this is a problem that needs to be addressed.
>68% upvoted  "If it's from The_Donald, maybe the people of Flint deserve to be poisoned." -Leftist mental gymnastics
This image makes it look like the house plumbing is to blame, rather than the city lines themselves.
Why would people downvote this?
Suck it democrats. You had 3 years to help with the issue and you did jackshit. But now it's come to the "Terrible Trump" followers to do you job. Looks like you're not all about social justice and environment issues as you claim. You just want to bitch about shit and do nothing about it. Fucking cucks. 
these people in flint need help they need water the fact obama gave 221 million to the damn pakistanis while ignoring this is complete and utter bullshit and i really hope trump will fix the problem (he will)
[removed]
If Trump fixes this he'll blow a hole in the "blue wall" so big democrats will never be able to recover.
This diagram does not seem applicable. The water source was changed and that brought the lead count up high I thought. Leaded solder in homes did not change in the past year or so. 
I appreciate the skepticism of many 'pedes on this, but seriously, whether or not it's a no-win situation for Trump politically is irrelevant. All that matters is that we agree that Flint deserves clean water.  It's Michigan's problem to fix, but the Feds will have to underwrite it. We can't pick and choose disaster areas to be concerned about, certainly not based on politics. 
Lead levels are now normal, but filters are still required: http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/flint-water-crisis/flint-water-has-fallen-below-federal-lead-limit
[deleted]
Incoming EPA chief Scott Pruitt says that he "hasn't looked at the scientific research" regarding how much lead is bad us to drink. How can we be sure this is even an issue for Flint?  http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2017/01/pruitt-safe-level-lead
More of this please. If the Trump folks can make this a cause... Talk about BTFO.
Real question... why does this have any downvotes ?
You can make a donation here: http://www.unitedwaygenesee.org/flintwaterfund  Just gave a small donation. I wish I could take back the money I donated to Bernie Sanders and give it to this fund instead. 
We have to provide clean water for all americans folks
To the top! The Democrats have done nothing for citizens of Flint. They've been without safe drinking water for a few years, and yet Obama sends over $200 million to Palestine on his way out, money that could have helped this situation. We should be putting Americans first. Imagine all the people who will **woke** up if President Trump can bring back jobs and clean water to the citizens of Michigan.  Is there a Twitter hashtag for fixing Flint's pipes? We should all tweet @POTUS with it.
Meanwhile, Trump just signed an executive order to push through the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. 
Why does this have to be a partisan issue? Would you not help those people if you couldn't post here about it?
The bottom line is this. It's going to cost ~~billions~~ millions.   The people of Flint elected people who made very bad choices. The people of Flint need to share the cost.  I would like to see special federal legislation for a one-time federal loan, maybe at 0.5% interest (so they can afford it) to the City of Flint, which the taxpayers of Flint will have to pay back to US taxpayers. The loan amount would be enough to get started on the project, with a line of credit sufficient to complete the project. I don't care what it takes. Just get it done.  As a condition of the loan, Flint can never be a sanctuary city, must conduct police operations with civil rights guarantees, the City of Flynt must transfer their water utility to another party--for no money--to the State of Michigan, which can do whatever it wants--and the City of Flynt will be forever barred from operating a water utility ever again.  Those tough conditions will stop a long line of cities asking for federal handouts of this nature.  I am sick and tired of this Flynt water issue. This is the USA. Fix it and move on.
Shouldn't Hillary come to the rescue since this happened under obama and they voted for Clinton to fix it?
Get Flint some fuckin' clean water!
The PLO money would cover all of what Gov Synder wanted to do but doesn't have the money for.  http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/05/27/flint-lead-lines-water-crisis/85032096/
There are incredible amounts of vacant land in Detroit, lots that used to contain homes connected to public utilities. Would it make more sense to consolidate? Migrate Flint to Detroit.
MAKE THE WATER CLEAN AGAIN!
So, let me see if I understand this:  The water is corrosive because of bad water treatment facilities? Or because that's just how the water in the Flint River is?   And this is causing lead in the pipes and pipe connectors to be corroded into the water? 
It's an infrastructure issue. It will be fixed. It's not even a race issue. 
We're gonna make flint great again. Flint is gonna have the greatest water we've ever seen. Incredible.
I heard a piece on NPR about how all the affected residents were offered filters and bottled water.  They went on to say that it wasn't a feasible solution because it required the residents to have to do something, like periodically change a free filter or go and get free water.  Can someone familiar with the situation confirm this?
Another question.  Is there a health risk to bathing in water with an elevated lead level?
This is a big issue that anyone conservative or liberal should support. The cost of fixing it will probably be high, but hopefully the energy of The_Donald can get people talking about this and working on a solution!
That's a nice picture.
I think this issue is well overdue to be fixed. They pay taxes in this great country. 
This is a real problem. Trump is a problem solver. Democrats are problem creators. Bad management and bad science like climate change.
This should have never been a partisan issue
Man holding up Flint Water sign is now top post on Reddit.https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-metropcs-us&hl=en-CA&oe=utf-8&safe=images&q=flint+water&source=browser-type&qsubts=1485289912636#scso=uid_WIe5uQAHpQ0KJkzIIAYlHg_0:267
The fact that this is only 80% upvoted says a lot about people.
NICE! This makes me especially happy as a Michipede
This issue is bipartisan everyone should upvote it regardless of what subreddit it's on 
I support this endeavor, lead is one of the most damaging things to developing children and can destroy lives for decades.  Those responsible knew about the risks and did it anyway and I hope they prosecute those, would be nice for the dems to stop holding up based Sessions so he can help out with this.
obama sending 220 million to palestine. yuck. if half of that went to flint im sure they would be in much better shape. 
DONALD WE KNOW YOU WILL COME THROUGH FOR FLINT!  MAGA

Hey reddit. THIS IS WHAT POLITICAL ACTIVISM LOOKS LIKE!
It feels fucking amazing to have a President who actually listens and addresses the issues the people want to be handled! After the first 100 days and President Trump completes all the campaign promises I hope we keep on winning for the next 7 and a half years!

Let me guesss. Reddit mods will ask us to stop talking about censorship in /r/news/.
[deleted]
I wrote this in response to the Fred Rogers reply talking about how the beliefs of the person who committed an atrocity like this aren't important. It's been deleted everywhere else, so hey, thought you guys might not delete it.   This is a really nice thought and I think you're a good person for thinking it.   But don't you have to separate beliefs from motivations in a horrible situation like this? If you shoot someone because you believe in X so strongly that you're willing to kill them for going against it, it's worth at least talking about.   It's the "why" part of horrible situations, which people inherently want to know.   Was it a grudge against a former employer? Did they have a mental disorder? Are they a white supremacist? Are they an Islamic extremist?   Motive is important in everything, and nightmarish situations like this are no different, even if it means that motive hurts some feelings. 
As a Brit gay guy i was recently banned from /r/worldnews and /r/unitedkingdom for pointing just how homophobic Islam is. How incompatable it is with the West, and how uneasy i am with the increasing prominance of this religion in our societies etc. Well i was banned due to "islamophobia" and "racism", the mods muted me when i asked why too. Well this tragic event just highlights how wrong these deanged, regressive idiotc mods are(i understand the head mods on both subs are devout muslims and islamists, which explains alot). Enough is enough at this point. I wish the people who defend the indifencible would wake up! :/.  Its a good thing they're are people outthere who arent gonna toe the line and are speaking out against this cancer on humanity and the modern world. The ridiculous censorship does far more harm than good.
What the fuck those mods are insane. I'm not even a trump supporter and here I am looking for thoughtful discussion.
Thank you /r/The_Donald for letting us talk about this tragedy. Every other sub is censoring our freedom. 
Sad that I have to go to r/the_Donald for uncensored comments. Not a fan of trump or this subreddit but I have lots of respect to the mods for letting people freely express opinions without censorship
i don't understand what's going on. i'm a neutral political person but this subreddit and national news are covering it but reddit seems to have squashed all other activity? are there any active threads from last night? i just woke up this morning and saw the identity thread and everything was removed/locked.  this is super creepy, the mods involved in this should immediately be stripped/outed.

The reason they are locking down /r/news is because the top 2 groups that reddit sjw's protect, were in direct conflict in Orlando, islamic terrorists, killing gays, their heads are about assplode.

r/news deleted the post that identifies him. Removed all comments and deleted a post with 3400 upvotes. How fucking sick are these mods?  A terrorist attack on Americans and fucking unpaid Reddit moderators are controlling social media. 
Hi guys, I'm an independent voter who has yet to fully make up his mind on this election (not voting for Hillary though). I just went on /r/news and the second highest post with the story revealing the name of the shooter was [LOCKED WITHIN 25 MINS AND ALL 41 COMMENTS NUKED](https://i.imgsafe.org/d7619f1859.png). There is no message from the moderators on this thread or the main thread as to why they were suddenly locked. This is LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE and it NEEDS to be discussed by people on reddit at large, but of course it won't be because people don't want to think about this happening. Get this shit to the front page guys.  edit: thanks to /u/lootkib for rehosting the screenie for me
You know I don't give a damn about American politics, Trump, the election or any bullshit like that but I really gotta give r/The_Donald credit for putting up this news story.  You guys and girls have been doing more than the casual subreddit shitposting. You find ways of putting stories out here that main stream media suppresses. You also find ways of getting past Reddit's suppressive algorithms. I hope r/The_Donald remains active after the election. We need collective communities that work together like you all to keep info flowing.  Thank you r/The_Donald
Lol did they delete the thread with the guys name on it now?`Omar something..   Fuck Reddit, censoring news on a fucking news subreddit should not be allowed. 
Again I ask. When did the /r/news sub started to become so full of censorship where even the TRUTH is erased, blocked and locked because it's not politically correct?  As soon as the FBI talked about this it was clear that the person responsible was very probably an Islamic terrorist. Threads where deleted and blocked, comments were and are being deleted.  Shameful. Shameful that Reddit has become a site where the truth cannot be said because the feelings of certain people are hurt or because someone is offended.  What's the agenda of /r/news mods? To suppress the truth so that the usual narrative can continue to be spread?  Grow up guys. Seriously, it's fucking shameful.  **EDIT: It's now clear why. The guy is a member of the Us Democrat party AND an Islamist**

We need to expose r/news the way we exposed r/politics.
Fuck this...full disclosure, I was a Bernie supporter for the longest time...I wanted to believe the best in humanity, that incidents of terror relating to radical Islam were a very small percentage, and that it was uncalled for to paint a broad stroke over an entire group...but seeing the utter CENSORSHIP on this site and the muffling of voices and information just to keep the SJW narrative going...no.  No more.  What's more important to these people? Protecting the lives of LGBTQ people who were just living their lives and not hurting anyone, or making sure no one could perceive them as racists after they so loudly defend a religion and culture that teaches death and destruction as a viable road to paradise.  FUCK EVERY LAST ONE OF THESE GODDAMN GOAT FUCKING ASSHOLES, and I am FULLY committed to putting a man in the White House who understands the threat we face.  These people were AMERICANS, and they deserved so much better than to die in this fashion.  Grab me a coat, and let's get to work on Making America Great Again.

i fucking love this subreddit
I find it hilarious that a thread that is locked about this news it pretty much at the top of the /all sorting...good job Reddit News Mods - you look all kinds of stupid.

I'm an undecided voter, but thanks for this sub posting this info. I have many friends in Orlando who frequent clubs.

From a list of the 14 traits of a fascist nation:  "6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common."
This is a hate crime terrorist attack. 
I just ran over here to say this. What a bunch of shit
Islamic terror attack on the United States, by a radicalized US citizen. 
WE'RE BREAKING THE CONDITIONING
Just want to thank these mods for not deleting everything.   I have learned to come to r/the_Donald for news. 
We have to get this to the top of Reddit so that people can know. Absolutely disgraceful that the mods of Reddit will censor this.  We're at war. Humanity is under attack. We need a leader. It doesn't matter if you are straight or gay, man or woman, white or black or brown or yellow. All that matters is that you do not submit, and these animals will kill you. Their leaders call for it. Their holy book calls for it. Their God calls for it.   Trump is the only person at that level who will call them for what they are. They have to be stopped.
Political correctness will destroy this country if we don't stop it from spreading. Im actually surprised the Lamestream Media hasn't twisted the story to blame the terror attack on Trump yet.
AND THEY DID IT AGAIN WITH THE NEW THREAD WTF
[removed]
This is fucking disgusting. This website has become a joke. You have censored the deaths of 50 people because of your ideology. You are worthless, awful human beings and I hope you can't sleep at night, mods of r/news.
It's insane to me that I have to up vote something in r/thedonald because Reddit won't allow discussion.  
Those muslim fucks murder gays in Saudi Arabia every day, I hope Trump tells those pajama wearing goat fuckers to jog on and refuses to defend them until they have atleast 10 churches and 10 gay bars in their desert. 
We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that this is a case of Islamic Terrorism just because the shooter is an Islamic Terrorist
thank you for getting this to the front.
This is some HUGE shit, reddit is going to take a very very big hit over this.    I am sick that so many were killed and injured, it breaks my heart, and this fucking website that has this :  https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency  is flat out CENSORING, locking down, banning, and muting people that bring up a news story of this level..  Folks are gonna lose their fucking minds.      The Donald, a fucking subreddit with around 150k people in it, is the only corner where it's being talked about openingly..  when a default sub nearly 9 million called NEWS is..  This is going to swing things lads.   
DOWNVOTE HARDER YOU FUCKING CUCKS  YOUR BULLSHIT WILL END, AND TRUMP WILL REMOVE KEBAB
Let's see who the liberals protect this time, Islam or Gays
This is why i'm voting for trump. The only fucking man with balls to call the devil by its name. The rest of the candidates want more muslim immigration because they are undoubtedly taking in huge amounts of money from saudi arabia to push that agenda. I know this site is hugely left leaning and hates trump, but guys please wake up. We can't sustain any muslim immigration when the 1% we have is already behaving like this. https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4nql8f/orlando_nightclub_shooting_megathread/
Here's what else you're not going to see:  * #westandwithamerica * #prayforamerica * #stopislamicterrorism * Reddit outpouring support for America, like with France.  What we *will* see is a bunch of leftist assholes screaming about us being racist, how there needs to be gun control, and how we're still wrong about people needing vetting before entering the country.  And this shit happened basically in my backyard (I live in the next county over), didn't think it'd happen to us, but here it is.
This is the only place I go for honest news and now it's no better than reading a Facebook wall. Nice job Reddit. 
I am now voting for Trump. I had every intention of voting for Gary Johnson until this incident. I will not allow a liberal media or a Muslim controlled subreddit to destroy free speech. There is no way on God's green earth that I will have Hillary as a president.
This sub is definitely getting banned - constant wrongthink at the top of /r/all.
Wow, reddit has never been this fucked up. There have been some crazy censorships lately but this one has been the most blatant one. Where are we going reddit?
Reddit, ladies and gentlemen. Controlled by SJW. If you wondered why /r/European got quarantined. You now have your answer.  We allowed stories like this to get posted.
You can find about 15 posts whining about the police though. That's news worthy apparently. I don't have to worry about the police strapping bombs to their chests and shooting at me with an ar-15.
[deleted]
This subreddit is basically r/all
[deleted]
Crazy... Never thought I would have to get my news from a Donald trump subreddit, but this seems to be the only place there is an actual discussion going on. What has happened to Reddit? News cannot be news when the truth is consistently hidden.
77% Upvoted. Fuck you downvoting cunts.
And the donald has a new subscriber. Well done /r/news mods! 
Normally I wouldn't come here... But bullshit censoring brings people together.
[deleted]
This is the only post from this sub I have ever upvoted or even commented on.
They are scrubbing every comment on every new submission about it.
This has to be fucking ridiculous. I don't even care about Trump or politics and I have to go to /all and here to read about the incident. Fuck this shit.
This is disgusting, they removed the comment that says it too. How fucking crooked can you get? With 53 people dead your going to hide facts from people just because it offends you? Fuck Reddit. That's gross. 
Sadly folks, this is just the beginning.  This attack was perpetrated by a Muslim American born in NY. We have taken in over 20,000 Syrian refugees in the last 8 months or so, some that are not vetted.  I fear it will only get worse as time goes on. This madness has to stop.
I just saw this. Unsubbed from /r/news. Something that blatant in their censorship shouldn't be a default sub.
#What the actual fuck?!  How can they be so self absorbed?  I've seen reddit mods acting like idiots and banning discussion on right leaning topics before, but these topics were mostly small and/or not that important to the general population so it didn't matter that much (I'm guessing).  #This time it is a fucking terrorist attack on U.S. soil! #Killing at least 50 people in cold blood! #Probably the biggest one since 9/11!  How in the **HELL** are they thinking they can keep it quite?  I've been waiting for half an hour for a thread here on /r/The_Donald  to pick up steam because I knew that if there is one place still sane here on reddit that this discussion won't be silenced it will be here.   #FUCK, this is unbelievable. 
Thank you for exposing the corrupt behavior of /r/news mods /r/The_Donald. This redditor thanks you. I'll just add that in addition to not allowing open discussion about the threat posed by Muslim extremism, they also refuse to allow discussion of the TPP.
[deleted]
Go over here /r/NewsNoCensorship  If you are tired of posts getting locked and comments getting removed. Nothing will get removed here at all, the users decides what gets shown by voting 
The poor woman bawling her eyes out on Stephanopoulos is just so wrong.  Already the calls for banning "assault weapons" beginning
I don't support Trump.   But I'm still voting for him.   With that said, I came to this sub as a (legal) immigrant/refugee because /r/news censored something very important and the mods are catering to hurt feelings. I am now subscribed to this sub.   **Down with censorship and safe zones.**
/pol/ was right again
[deleted]
Any admins we can email about this?   
I messaged the mods there to tell them they look like fascist pussies for silencing discussion and modifying what get's posted. We'll see how long it takes to get banned/muted.  Edit: Muted from messaging for 72 hours. It took them 17 minutes to get to me lololol EVERYONE SHOULD BE MESSAGING THOSE BUTTHOLES
[deleted]
Watch Shillary try to make this about gun control.
Gotta say it,  Trump was right. He will be the next president of the US.
I'm not really a fan of Trump, but I gotta say, fuck r/news and their censorship. Thank you guys for allowing me to find information about the attack. You are the saviors of redditors looking for news on the attack this morning.
WOW. LOOK AT ALL THE TRASH THE WOMEN'S MARCH PARTICIPANTS LEFT! It would be a shame if /all saw how seedy these people truly are. Where is the outcry for our environment?
It's okay, people with jobs will pick it up.
Complains about Trump's views on the environment  Leaves huge pieces of trash on the streets.  What?
This reminds me of the earth day rallies. Garbage everywhere.
Remember when Tea Party Conservatives would have huge events and leave places cleaner than when they got there? 
[deleted]
Trees died for this.
Not even 24 hours in and Trump has gotten more fat women to walk than michelle obama has in in 8 whole years.
I'm all for equality for women and peaceful protest but I mean c'mon, don't leave trash lying around.
Classy people
Trash makes trash.
Looks like a woman's restroom.
Plenty of fodder for the homeless to use as bonfire fuel.  That's about all the feminist movement is good for; keeping the homeless warm.
I sexually identify as an earth and I am tired of seeing other earths abused. 
Some women can be so fucking corny, like, adults made those signs.
BUT HE'S GOING TO DESTROY THE ENVIRONMENT!  *Leaves literal tons of trash behind*
[deleted]
I noticed this during the TEA party times, that they would bag up their trash, and centralize it for easy pickup.  Leftists just destroy any and everything they touch.
this is pretty typical behavior from the left, they pretend to give a shit about the environment but they literally never clean up after themselves. 
Dedicated environmentalists!
#SUCH NASTY WOMEN 
"In other news, a local hair salon owner makes triple her yearly revenue in a single day as pink hair dye sales skyrocket."
Does anyone else feel like most of America got over hating trump and that this women's march and antifa crap is just making them realise how bad the democrats are?
Nuh-uh mother fucker. The job listing  said protest for 8 hours. It didn't say shit about cleaning up afterward.
They're like little kids in many ways. 
I hope /r/TrollXChromosomes/ sees this shit. Most of them are circle jerking over the marching going on today all over the world, no one is really claiming on how to be a better person or acknowledging this kind of crap. Great job, ladies! Keep up the trolling. You're really winning over the hearts and minds of america. /s
That's nothing.  Imagine the mess all their millions of cats made after being left home alone all day.
Pigs will be pigs 
Nice jobs assholes, pick up your shit and take it with you next time. 
What are they marching for exactly...?  -Marching against sexism? while dressing up as vaginas & getting Miss Blowjob (madonna) to speak?  -Marching for equal pay? We've had laws for that already since the 60's, it's not my fault they have a worthless degree in gender studies & that women statistically go into lower paying jobs. Not to mention that women usually make 10-15% more than men in white collar jobs after a few years.   -Marching for control over our bodies but I am the one who has to contribute to paying for your healthcare?   -Marching for gay rights yet they support Hillary Clinton who willingly took in millions of dollars in donations from Saudi Arabia where they stone homosexuals & oppress women?   The truly courageous women were the ones marching in places like Nigeria & Saudia Arabia where there is Sharia law & women are actually oppressed. This just seems like another anti-Trump protest march, in which case there is nothing more to see. 
[removed]
The real trash is their ideas.  They've been fine with nsa, wars, corporations, everything bad we know about.  They're such hypocrites it amazes me 
While I may not completely agree with Donald's views, its abysmal, cringey, and completely sad with how Liberals are behaving regarding this.  Like, no Republican wanted Obama's second term, but hey, they got through it But woah, why do so many people think Donald raped someone? Look at all of the rape accusations, why do we believe every single one leveled against Donald? Its ridiculous.
Saw the same thing today in my city. I viewed it as a poignant metaphor for their disposable convictions.
I think we can all agree that the real amazing thing that happened today was that President Trump motivated these fatties to walk. Not in office a full 24 hours and he is already having a positive benefit on the health of women in this country. 
"**Not ur bitch**" - don't worry, nobody made the mistake of thinking that you were.  "**I'm with HER**" - oh, we couldn't tell, you're here virtue signalling and doing nothing of value, you fit right in.  "**BUILD BRIDGES NOT WALLS**" - well see we're physically connected to Canada and Mexico, so a bridge doesn't make much sense there.  "**Feminism is the radical notion that**" - I'll stop you right there, feminism is the radical notion that you're an idiotic cunt who doesn't even know that you have more rights than men in your home country and who literally doesn't care that women are having their genitals mutilated, are being forced into marriage, and raped/killed in the middle east by an actual oppressive ideology that feminists support yet our president has sworn to protect you and LGBT members from. But FUCK YEAH FEMINISM!  "**Unity**" - only we'll force you to cooperate with us, we're not budging. And we're the inclusive, diverse ones!  "**Women use our Power for Good**" - what power? This isn't a comic book where you have super powers. The only thing you did was waste a lot of your time protesting.. nothing, literally nothing, and then leave a mess on this sidewalk. I'm still waiting for those "powers" and for this "good" you speak of.  "**PU$$Y POWER**" - oh so you're 12? Cool, I was busy hacking computers when I was 12, it's why I have a job and you're stuck walking around carrying that retarded sign.  "**CHOOSE LOVE**" - what happened to hope? Did Trump manage to destroy your hope? Fucking A, what a president!  "**DONT BACK DOWN**" - wait what? Why would you tell me not to back down? I mean you don't have to because I won't, but that's weird.  I need to watch videos of this march. If this is just a small sampling of those signs, I'm sure there's so much entertainment to be had.  Edit: thanks for the gold, I'm going to use it to plate the inside of my apartment so I can feel more like Trump!
Half a million out there and not one single proper Lady among them.
[deleted]
Modern feminism is just trash in general
At least the bulk of the trash already left.
This is so typical of lefty turd-heads.  They respect nothing while demanding respect for themselves.  They should have marched in Iran or Saudi Arabia.  They would be jailed by now but at least I could send my love and respect.
Eco terrorists
I was down there today. It was like this EVERYWHERE. Not only signs but just trash everywhere
THE ENVIRONMENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE EVAR!!  Hey guys, let's litter like fucking crazy and ruin the environment!  So much progressiveness, my heart burns.
Just walked past this on my way to get some dumplings in Koreatown..earlier in the day I took notice as none of the protestors paid any mind to the numerous homeless individuals in and around grand central..caught a few people snapping pics of them though and snickering, truly humanitarians.
That's some real environmental activism. 
Fucking hypocrites. Safe bet that half of them (at least) don't even know why they're out there. Also, safe bet that half of them (again, at least), didn't even vote.     I'm so fucking glad Trump won, for this reason especially. It'll be a long 4 (hopefully 8) years of listening to these leftist crybabies, but I know I'll be enjoying it with my fellow centipedes. 
shameful...where is their sense of Earth Rule #1 - do not litter the world with your trash and to dispose of it in a way that disrespects the earth. this trash and disrespect shows how little they care about anyone other than themselves
[deleted]
Post this to /r/pics and get banned.
Sloppy women.  No wonder they're still single
The photo looks like the aftermath of some terrible terrorist attack, but instead of bullets they used platitudes.
"Women use our power for good"  Yeap good for creating a giant mess for other people to clean up. 
Worst part is, they didn't even listen to his speech.  **HIS MESSAGE WAS EQUALITY.**
They left their signs lined up on a fence earlier and i knocked one over and this lady is like, "Really? Was that really necessary?" I told her, "Was it really necessary to litter in the first place?"
RIP whoevers job it is to clean the bathrooms along the parade route. Women can be fucking disgusting.
These are the same bitches that whine and moan about keeping our national parks clean, and admonish people to "leave it as you found it" when on the Appalachian Trail - except for the trail of cigarette butts and weed droppings they leave behind.      Disgusting hypocrites, the lot of them.  Fuck those barren bitches.
[deleted]
You know, a bunch of men are going to have to clean all that up 
Wow, when will feminists realize that this is exactly why they're not taken seriously? 
Seriously fuck these people. I live in DuPont Circle in DC and five people left their signs on the street. We kindly asked them to pick them up. Their response?   "Get your slaves to do it, we owe you nothing"  P.S. I'm a fucking white male 
As a woman, Boys, let me tell you something...those blue haired fat gals, are disgusting adults as they get older too.   I've been a married mom for 26 Years (next Tuesday!).   I can tell you that attractive (you know naturally pretty - not trashy) young Trump woman who take care of their own appearance are your best chance at finding happiness with someone who decades on will care a) about keeping up their own appearance. B) care about making you happy c). Keep a neat and clean home d). Can feed nightly cooked meals to you and your children.     I've seen through my kids school friends glimpses into slobby wives lives and it's nasty.   Kids with dirty clothes, meals sporadic at best, homes that look like a train wreck inside all the time.   Sad husbands and divorced husbands.   Guys get out there and find Your special Trump girl.  I'm telling you it's the best dating advice I can ever give.
The DAPL rioters burn tires on the roads. I'm starting to think they don't care too much for the environment.
They carried all that crap into DC so take it out with you 
The men of the sanitation department will clean it up.
And the people cleaning it will be male city workers.
At least they had sign making credits in the pursuit of their liberal arts degree.
Wow, they sure do respect nature. 
#SLOBS
HYPOCRITESSS
as a preface, I don't hate women (im not a muslim, I actually think women are people too).  but i'm a little confused as to what the purpose of this march is.  let's look at some of the signs here:  "not ur bitch"  well, uh...that's a compelling argument you have there.  not sure what to say.  "build bridges not walls"  you see, a wall wouldnt be necessary at all if illegals stopped jumping the border.  we dont hate immigrants, at all.  we LOVE *legal* immigrants, who migrate the fair way.  they helped build this nation!  a wall is needed to keep the assholes who want to ruin things for everyone else out, the illegals.  they want to skip the line and go to the front.  no, immigration is a process.  respect it.  "pu$$y power"  not getting this one, is this a pro-prostitution sign?  if so, consider going to vegas!  "unity"  a great idea, but all that is happening here is stuff that divides the nation, with the assumption that republicans all hate women, for whatever reason.  that's bullshit and you know it.  you do realize kellyanne was the first woman to manage a campaign for president that ended in victory, right?  did donald hate her?  nope!  also, of all his kids the first one that comes to mind is ivanka, and not just cause of her good looks.  if he hated women, how could he raise such an amazing daughter?  ...  free speech is great, but if you use it in a bad way like this all you are doing is causing more harm than you realize.  if you people hate walls, why are you building them yourselves with harmful words or generalizations?  and uh, if you want respect then stop fucking littering.  the sidewalk is not your garbage can.  thanks!
[deleted]
Just like with computers: Garbage In Garbage Out.
#THANKS FOR HELPING CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE, LIBERALS!!!
Disgusting women I hate to see what their house looks like.  
The signs are so lame... I don't even get what most of them are suppossed to say? "Not ur bitch", "Women use our Powers for good", "Pussy Power", "Choose Love" uh, ok I guess?
These people are so impotent in every faucet of their lives.

R/edacted:  But did you see that the Obama administration deleted their stuff off of the white hours website? Are we literally under nazi Germany? CNN!!! More Kool-Aid please!! Salon!!! What's your opinion today??
Dumb SJWs.  We're building bridges AND walls.  And roads and airports and railways and so on.         
Let's be clear, everyone.  All of these signs were unique and vital. They left them because every last one will be added to the National Archives with some of the most spectacular signage to be on display in a dedicated wing at the Smithsonian.  -- H
[deleted]
No but really,  why are they protesting? Trump hasn't done shit to oppress us. I'm a American Latina who voted for him. I work, drive a car, have an education. I don't have insurance because fuck crazy expensive ass obamacare. I have a nice home and warm food on the table. I don't worry about my daughters having to wake to  bullshit like in Syria. Definitely not at all with Trump in office now. I wear skirts and tank tops without fear of getting my ass whooped by a goat fucker.  We got it made, dude. Exactly wtf are these women bitching about now?
Lovely people, lovely.
Bad!
Disgusting 
I'm still trying to figure out what rights I have that women don't. In fact, it seems more and more each day I'm being told by women what I don't have a right to do.
Trump got more fat women exercising in one day in office than Michelle Obama did in eight years
[deleted]
These women in particular don't deserve much better than a life of servitude, to be frank.
This just in, to the surprise of literally nobody with common sense, liberals are raging hypocrites.
Leftist protestors always leave a place looking worse than when they arrived.  Meanwhile, after the rare times that conservatives protest (because they're too busy working, raising families, and winning), the area is cleaned up afterwards.
Now time to send in some unionized sanitation workers at $30 an hour (probably at 1.5x pay from this since it's the weekend) to do the job that women wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole. There's your wage gap.
[deleted]
Trashy grubs. All they know how to do is trash shit up and leech off society. 
This is just a pic of the front of the trump hotel where they all stopped to leave their signs
EACH SIGN REPRESENTS DREAMS DASHED.  
Feminists can't clean or tidy up after themselves, who would have guessed.
That's all these lefty types are good at... making colourful signs.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DONALD J. TRUMP IS OFFICIALLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
"For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left. And the factories closed.  The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation’s capital,  there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes starting right here and right now. Because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you.  It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country.  What truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.  The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.  ....  We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it's going to be only America first -- America first.  Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body. And I will never, ever let you down.  America will start winning again, winning like never before.  ... ....  We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world.  But we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow.  We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones. And unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.  At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.   ... ....  Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.  The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It’s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget -- that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.  We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.  ... ...  So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words -- you will never be ignored again.  Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And yes, together, we will make America great again. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you. God bless America."   Full speech here:   http://www.npr.org/2017/01/20/510629447/watch-live-president-trumps-inauguration-ceremony
I admit, I did not vote for this man (nor Hillary) yet I hope he succeeds so well that I will do so in 4 years. Congratulations to him and wish him and US all the best.

Did anyone else see Ivanka say "I'm so proud of you dad"?
When is he going to get the official @POTUS twitter account? I need to know when I have to actually follow it!  Pez: Holy shit he has it now!
Congratulations and good luck America, may you prosper under new administration. I hope USA and Finland will continue to co-operate in good, warm and friendly terms.
Have to confess I breathed a big sigh of relief the moment he was sworn in.
Up voted. I don't agree with him on many things, but being an American on an American site, this should be the top post of this site
All that matters now is figuring out how bernie can still win.
I had a few liberal friends that I have been able to have tons of civil conversations with over the past year, but not today.  They absolutely broke, and I loved every second of it.
I got a new boss today.  He seems like a pretty cool dude.

We are all on the same airplane.  Leftists, regressive or not, need to stand behind this man for now. If you want to attack him wait until his policies start being brought up.  If you disagree with those then youll have something to actually be angry about.  I hope Trump is the greatest fucking president we've ever had. Never forget that we are in this together. I don't care who you voted for - we are all Americans. We want what we believe is best for our country. The last few presidents have been catastrophic failures. Let's hope he is not the same
Lol funny how a main thread in the President's main sub hits homepage and disappears shortly after whereas the politics article ripping him stays #1 
America is back on tracks now. It's winning time.
God Bless America!

I don't agree with Trump 100%, but he is the President now, and I support him.  This is an opportunity to rebuild this country and move forward.  
I didn't vote for Trump, and I'm still very skeptical about his decisions for this country, but until he is impeached, killed, resigns **or until he just does his 4-years and retires in space on the Trump Moon-Base**, he is *my* president and leader of the greatest country in the world, and I will give him the same respect I have given Barack Obama.  God Bless America 
It's been a pleasure, guys.

MAGNIFICENT SPEECH!
[deleted]
[deleted]
TREMENDOUS!   A magnificent speech!  Such an inspiring start to a new era, not only for America, but for the whole world.  God bless us all!
BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST
Not exact quote but I loved when he said somethin along the lines of "today is an important day. Not only because we're shifting power from president to president, or from party to party. But because we're shifting power from Washington DC to the rest of America" 
Yesterday I said the picture of Trump that hit 0 was going to be the most brigaded picture on Reddit.  I take it back.  This is probably going to beat it.
Hovering around 300 points.   Are we brigading ourselves?!?!   REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
We did it pedes! 🤡
I've never seen salt levels rise this quickly within the left
[removed]
I just watched the speech in its entirety, and while I may not agree with many things that he has said or done during the campaign, I thought it was well thought out and overall a very nice way to transition.  I may have been critical of him even up to a few hours ago, but I think he may have what it takes to make a difference.  I'm making this post here because I believe the division must heal so we can become deserving of our title "Leaders of the Free World".  So with that I say: good luck President Donald Trump.  
[deleted]    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9006   > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/78346)
That speech was empowering, very moving.  And did you see Bill Clinton's face afterwards?  He actually looked inspired and/or proud to me!
Here bro take my upvote. New chapter, new beginning, and most importantly new America!  - From your fellow friendly Liberal/Conservative/independent.... uuuhhh I mean American!
I am pretty sure Obama's asshole puckered up during the speech.
Im not even American ( Canadian) and i've been smiling all day. I literally got chills during the swear in. I wish someone would sponsor me for citizenship.
Say it with me lads, RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM!

I don't know why people are so worried about President Trump. He's going to work with both sides of the aisle. He has no allegiance to the Republican party just because he ran as a Republican. People should be happy that someone who is good at negotiating a deal will be running the country. If you think I'm wrong, you need to wake up. 
It's been a good year and a half, guys.   I've been to rallies, been yelled at in class (and demolished the other person in a debate), gotten attacked (but won) and had the wonderful opportunity to game some female Trump supporters at his rallies (way hotter than the Hillary supporters).   I fucking love you all, the fights not over and it's been real good bashing political correctness and rustling jimmies and triggering liberals with all of you and challenging the narratives we've been force fed.   Looking forward to a good 4 years to come, and hopefully another 4 after that.   Take care, praise Pepe.

Thank you all, every single last one of you, for making this country hopeful again, for making our President great again, and for making Reddit fun again.  -  "He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them." -Psalm 78:45  "Fools find no pleasure in understanding but delight in airing their own opinions" -Proverbs 18:2  "Let us tear off their shackles from us, and cast off their chains." -Psalm 2:3  "Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!" -Donald J. Trump

Donald Trump has been paying a Trump Tower hotel room for a homeless woman for 8+ years without asking anything in return, offering her flowers every week! Would be a shame if this reached r/all
CNN: Racist Trump Holds Black Woman Hostage For 8 Years  Edit: lol guys, don't buy Reddit gold!  Give to a worthy charity instead.
I'm suspicious because the story doesn't sound right. The police turned up and contacted Donald Trump when she said she wouldn't leave? I mean... I guess it is possible... but I would have thought they would have just grabbed her and escorted (or dragged) her out.  I want this to be true... but I'm wary of being fooled; this story would be too easy to fabricate.
[deleted]
honestly sounds fishy, after 8 years she probably has squatter rights.  That sorta looks like the trump building on colombus circle judging from the view...could be wrong. Trump lives and works on 5th ave, so it would be strange for him to come down. NYPD would have just dragged her ass with a green light from the manager.
If real,  it's a wonderful story.   I'm not sure it's real though, because I would assume this info would have been an area of focus for his pr team.    
Seems incredulous to me, but I suppose the truth of the matter will come out in time. No doubt Trump has done many a good deed in the past, however. 
#Sounds fishy
How can she not improve her lot after 8 yrs?  Wtf
Our President-Elect is a good guy
I like that Trump is a great self-promoter but is humble about his charitable giving.  >Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you,    as the hypocrites do...    - Matthew 6:1  - e: My first gold, thanks! 
This needs to be verified.  The last thing we ought to do is spread this around before we know it's legit.  
Don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, but this tweet comes from a German twitter account that in the past posted fake news repetitive times. proof: https://twitter.com/OnlineMagazin/status/806794281658654721/photo/1 http://www.mimikama.at/allgemein/fake-news-moselkurier2/  The first link shows them tweeting a screenshot of an article by the so-called "Mosel-Kurier" and the second is an analysis of why this sites articles are fake.
CNN: Donald Trump Suppressing Black Vote by hiding black woman in hotel!
As much as I think it is a bad idea to let squatters squat, and to just subsidize the homeless instead of helping them find a better life, this is an insanely generous and almost disgustingly righteous thing to do on Trump's part. This is how charity should be, the government should never force anybody to do things like this. It has to come from the heart.
I'd have to see some proof before I believe this is real sadly. I want it to be real, but it doesn't quite seem to add up. 
If this is true, The funny thing is that Trump could of used this during his campaign when they tried to pull the race card, but he was humble enough man that he didn't.

That's wonderful and all, but after 8 years it would seem to me that this lady is just now mooching and taking advantage of Trump. Plenty of time to get back on your feet, what the hell's the hold up lady? 
Sorry folks buts that's fucking ridiculous. You can't reward criminal behaviour like that
An easy fact check would be asking the door man if he has seen this woman come in and out of building.

"So people, Donald Trump is not..."  *video cuts off*  Looks like CNN are back at it again
Looks like it has reached /r/all!
56% upvoted. Wow, you have to be really sad to downvote something like this. THANK FUCK Trump won.
It enrages me how the left is so disgusting that they would assassinate this great man's character with total and complete lies like they did. Trump is so selfless in these acts, he doesn't even reference them in defense to their attacks when he could easily shut them up. He is very modest when it comes to things like this (REAL THINGS) and doesn't like to publicize them.   This is the real Trump. 
This is really questionable. Too many holes in this tweet.
This was first out in the news about 4 months ago. Has not been verified but being Donald Trump quite possibly true. 
This is amazing! 
Edit: Rip inbox haha
Yeah, despite not being anti Trump I'm really gonna need actual proof to believe this. I hate to say it but it would be so easy to ask an employee to do this. So many questions, like why would Trump deal with this personally? If she wants to repay him, why not wash dishes or clean? Nine years and no desire to try in some way to reciprocate free room and board? What kind of person is OK with that?
You watch this and it begs the question:  what myriad other things has Mr. Trump done that nobody knows about to help out ordinary people?  Anyone who thinks Trump is racist or a misogynist or anything but generous needs to watch this so they can see how the media has blinded them to the truth about the President-Elect 
That made me tear up a bit. That was really touching. Look...he could have dropped this story during the election. Did he? No.  He doesn't do these things for recognition. The press is so horrible to treat this wonderful man like they do. They should be ashamed. 
How on earth could anyone downvote this? I mean really. At some point you gotta let the sun break through your clouds of intolerance and just say, "You know what, this is a nice thing that happened." 
44% of Reddit hates the fact that Donald Trump let a black homeless woman stay at Trump Tower for free. Let that sink in
This cant be true! I looked at trumps tax returns and he barely had any charitable donations!  Unlike hillary who donated 100% of her taxable income to her daughters wedding!!!  /S
And the fact that he never used her to promote himself makes him an even better man
Jesus Christ, I just sat down to the computer and now I feel like crying. That's the kind of thing you only hear when you and your friends are bullshitting around a table 'Yeah, well if I was a billionaire I'd...'  Heart of fucking gold, man. Proud he's MY President.
She might be suffering from  a disability that's why she's been living there for 8+ years. Maybe she can't get a job? Maybe she doesn't have family? Idk, but if this story is true, god damn Trump has a heart of GOLD. 
She isn't really homeless then
#CNN: TRUMP PITIES AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN
Doesn't make sense, he'd expect the woman to pick herself up and move on with her life, but she hasn't? Why keep her around? He's generous to the needy but that only lasts so long as the needy want to make themselves better. This is purposefully exaggerated, it's fake.
From New York. Actually teared up a little from this video. Homelessness is still a problem we all walk by every single day. Most of those people on the street didn't do anything particularly bad to end up where they are. They won't harass you for money and they'll take what they're given with a smile and a blessing. I never see much of a reaction even if I decide to walk on by and look the other way.  My point is, as a New Yorker we kind of take for granted the fact that they're there. We even jokingly tease tourists for their appalled sympathy; like there's some sort of justification that puts them sleeping on the street and you using it to get Bloomingdale's.   I'm not really criticizing anyone either way, but it takes a lot of balls to step up and say 'you know what, its about time someone gave this person a break,' and to make that break happen. And I'm proud that a guy who's from New York and knows the shit these people go through is the one to do it. Politics and all that other shit aside, this is a good deed; and the fact he kept it quiet shows some real integrity. Good for Donald.

The fact that they're downvoting this shows just how full of shit the bleeding heart left is.
Hmm....  This seems iffy... Did she earn squatters rights and Don just didn't want to deal with the hassle?
Question: How can she stand to live off someone's generosity for 8 years seemingly without any desire to improve herself?
Sounds fishy, but also looks suspicious too. Why doesn't she ever show the room? Why is she so close to the window? I'm thinking she could be in some hallway acting like she's in a room and doesn't want the camera to catch anything that doesn't fit her story.

I'm a lip reader and this isn't making sense with what I'm hearing. It looks fake to be honest. It's not just out of sync. I can't see any of the words on her lips. Is there a better video? 
This sums up Trump. A generous man who cares about and connects with every day people. The media and demonrats tried to turn him into a racist bigot who rapes women, rips off contactors, and fails at business. Fake News sickos! GOOD RIDDANCE TO SLIME BALL HARRY REID!
Our president is a kind man who care about people. 
How do you trust this source? Anyone can be filmed in a hotel room. Just saying. 
CNN: Trump keeps negro sex slave locked up in trump tower for 8 years!
Donald Trump's childhood home was in an upscale white neighborhood. But that's not where he grew up. Trump's father was a landlord in some of the worst underprivileged black neighborhoods that NYC had at the time.   (Before Trump turned NY into the most desirable city in the world)   And this is where Trump was brought up. Trump is basically a black guy with white skin.  
What are her circumstances so that she can't get her own place?
send this shit to the frunt payj
Jeese I'm going to sneak into a Trump hotel!!
If this is true, there is a very good reason it was not publicized before.  Trump and his staff would not want to advertise that homeless people were getting free room and board.  It would've looked like a scene from the Walking Dead outside Trump tower.
[deleted]
What is the back story on this? Is she living there on her own free will? I am assuming over the eight years she has been taught the best of education and is going to get a job and her own place soon. Doubt Donald Trump would just give here a fish when he would of course teach her.
What a monster!
That is really good. But unless there is some real physical issue with this woman, there is no excuse to go out and get a job. 
til now, the reason he gives me the warm and fuzzies was unclear
I am all for helping people in need out, and this sounds like a great act of charity. Admittedly, I do not know the whole story, but I have to ask... After 8 years, what is going in her life that she is not able to move away from this?
Why is she not working for 8 years should be the question LOL
8 years?  Time to get a job!
Uhh for 8 YEARS?
This is new to me.

B..bu...but my hivemind agenda!  It's ruined!  **NOOOOOOO**
Reading these CNN headlines makes me both laugh and cringe, knowing that this shit would actually happen. 
**My guess is brain damage- possibly from drug abuse. Keeping her off the streets has prob saved her life.**
FUCKING RACIST WOMEN HATER!  Seriously though, you don't see the Clintons giving anyone a place to live for free.
I remember another one. Someone helped trump with car problems ( not too sure) and he ended up paying off the mortgage of their house. I'm pretty sure I remember this from The Apprentice.    Edit: https://youtu.be/aDKYYoYLInc
There's a lot of comments regarding the legitness of this video, I truly hope it is true & real.   Other than that, I wanted to say that she really looks & sounds like "crazy eyes" from orange is the new black... No disrespect intended. 
Allergies are acting up again--sniff sniff
CNN: its because he knew he was going to be president 8 years later of course.
She's not homeless then, is she?
I don't get it she broke the law and now is rewarded. I'm confused.
Holy shit. Is this real? What a fucking legend. 
Shows how sincere he is. He didn't use this as publicity during  his powerful campaign, to help counter all the heartless and racist allegations against him.

REMINDER! Since Berkeley, there has been a sudden (and slightly suspicious) influx of posts here calling for retaliatory violence. DO NOT CONDONE THIS! All eyes are on us at the moment, do not give them any fuel to use to further the narrative that we are the violent ones!
Just a reminder to please be sure to report (deport) any comments or posts that call for violence, or anything else that violates our rules.  Thanks.
[deleted]
Media Matters and ShariaBlue are now posing as T_D users and saying we should retaliate. They are trying to stir us up!
Violent backlash from the right is exactly what they're looking for so they can start point fingers and calling *us* the violent ones. 
If there's a riot or protest where you live, PLEASE LIVESTREAM WITH A DRONE. Get as many faces as you can
If the violent protesters stay in Cali then they won't have any problems with violent defenders.  The ones that tried to cause trouble in NY got their asses kicked by the police.  They tend to stay around the cucked cities and very liberal and cucked campuses.  
protect yourself but try to stay away from the retards.  "dont stop your opponent when they are currently punching themselves in the face."  Abe Lincoln 
The Quebec attack should serve as a reminder that when you resort to violence, you cede the moral high ground.   And just look at how much the Berkeley attacks are helping our cause. Why would you ever hand that to your opponent?   Violence is a self-serving action. It accomplishes nothing but to make you feel better in the moment. You gain nothing for your cause by turning yourself into that which you're claiming to oppose. 
as the Donald gets bigger and accepts more people beware of the sheeps in wolf clothing who will pretend to be one of us.    Some of them will be patient and wait until their numbers are large, then they will post utter garbage and it will miraculously find its way to R/All in an attempt to discredit all the fine work done on this glorious subreddit!  Only one thing for it lads!    **EXTREME VETTING**

You don't need violence when you've got the dankest memes 
I don't get people,   i say how this violence is disgusting and should be avoided at all costs and they say "don't you own guns and carry a knife?"  Yeah i have them to protect myself and my family against those types of people and would never use them offensively. 
Its funny too. There are 20 minute long videos of Trump supporters being assaulted and not a peep from the media. They are just waiting for one time a pede slips up to pounce. This is why no one trusts the media anymore, we all see it.
Mods sticky this. Just to get many people to see this and keep it fresh in their head. Very, very important.
I only condone violence in self defense. If you are being attacked you sure as fuck better be ready. These people are increasingly getting bolder, because the police refuse to do their job or are being told to not do their job by their superiors. 
Not a Trump supporter, but I really appreciate this sentiment from you folks.   Upvoted
It's a baiting tactic - we need to be perfectly clear that we will never fall for it

I'm an Australian who hates everything about Trump and what you would call a "leftard".  Violence is never a solution regardless of whether they are watching you closely or not.  Please ignore any calls to violence in retaliation regardless of who is promoting it.
I want law and order. I want convictions. I want long jail terms in actial prison for these nazis. That is not retaliation. That is justice.
and report that shit!  they are trying to infiltrate us and make
DO NOT FUCKING TOUCH A LEFTY, THEY HAVE THE WORLD BEHIND THEM. BEAT THEM WITH FACTS SINCE THEY HAVE NONE'
Don't water the *plants*.
They play the victim card all the time but make actual victims out of us. They play the race card all the time but are the actual racists. They accuse us of fascism while being fascists. They say we are hatemongers and they hate us for it. It's hard for me to think of a position where they are not a steaming pile of hypocrites. They want ammo. If we strike back we give them more bullshit victim points. People are wising up. It looks like we should just keep taking punches a while longer. We are going to win and big. The numbers we gain everyday will make it easier. Let's not only work hard. Let's work smart too.

They ( soros/extreme left wing) need the right to escalate their violence before more redpills drop. They are scared and not above hurting their own. Stay the course you dirty land lovers or it be the plank for ye. 
The right have become the peaceful hippies, what a crazy timeline we live in pedes.
At this point, anyone that thinks that the violence is coming from the right is too far gone to be reasoned with.
We are not violent. We are not rascist. We are not Nazis.  Fake news is everywhere, and they are waiting to catch someone in a Trump hat doing something stupid.
If you feel that must have a firearm to keep you safe in a area, it may be prudent to avoid that area unless you must go.
make sure to report them all
Most of those people are people who just want this sub to get banned. 
Same shit happened at /pol/ and the threads continue to appear.  Lots of comments from /pol/ regulars to avoid violence, let cops do their work, and don't go to protests where violence may occur.   What's interesting is the variety of psychological hooks being used to engage /pol/acks. CTR obviously is testing themes and messages to figure out what works. 
Shills trying to (a) make us look like violent thugs, and (b) shills hoping that maybe some of us are stupid enough to go out and beat or shoot a protestor.  This is exactly their plan, folks. Be smart. Don't fall for their transparent trap.
No violent backlash happened like they expected. So now they are trying to create a fake one. 
Every time I want to, I just try to remember that I have a job and opportunity and throwing that away to get even with some SJW welfare trash is just not worth it

No need to retaliate.    "It's over Anakin - I have the high ground!"
I'm not going to retaliate and I'm certainly not going to purposefully put myself in a situation where I am anywhere nears this sort of thing.   However if I get caught out unexpectedly I will defend myself. I live pretty far away from where any of this sort of thing could happen though so thankfully I'm all but 100% certain I won't deal with it. 
It's insane that this post, which discourages reactive retaliatory violence, is only 63% upvoted simply because it's on the Donald.  Just because somebody is a trump supporter doesn't mean you can't agree on logical issues.   This all or nothing accepting of belief sets is toxic.  -a politically moderate human 
sure wish I could just be myself in public without be threatened with violence
Not a Trump supporter but your post shows more integrity than 90% of my Facebook friends. You deserve the recognition. 
Why don't we retaliate violently by setting up a GoFundMe and helping cover the $100k in property damages?  Forget the hypocrisy of the events for a moment and show these people who we and what we are?
#THIS
https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/827488947735494658  Top comments on PJW's tweet are calling for retaliatory violence.  This is shady as shit and obviously a ploy of CTR/Soros.  The moment we fight back is the moment we lose.  As long as it's only the left causing violence, more and more people will wake up.  Peaceful resistence, pedes!!
They are provoking us. Lets stay away from protests and not even try to counter protest. We got jobs to do, bills to pay, kids to feed and ways of making society better for everyone. Lets not stup to their level. MAGA! thats all we need to do.
I love it when you guys hit the front page with stuff like this.
The left-wing group that helped organize the violent shut down of the Milo Yiannopoulos event at the University of California, Berkeley on Wednesday is backed by a progressive charity that is in turn funded by George Soros, the city of Tucson, a major labor union and, ironically, several large financial institutions.  The Global Alliance for Justice, based in Tucson, is listed as an organizer and fiscal sponsor for Refuse Fascism, a communist group that encouraged left-wingers to shut down the Yiannopoulos event.    
Totally agree. It's a troll. They want us to be violent to justify their narrative. Non violent resistance is the single most effective method for change in America. 
Too important to ignore. Please do you duty and be on new and rising to weed out shills and concern trolls. We cant have hate infiltrate our sub. Choose love, MAGA
Yeah, the tone in some posts has changed.  Good catch.
When they go LOW we go HIGH!!!!
As we saw with MLK and Ghandi. A movement's righteousness is demonstrated in its peacefulness and compassion. Which the left has none of. If we are not only peaceful but compassionate (i.e. calling for the Flint crisis to be dealt with), then we are the moral superiors and will draw in more centrists and reasonable left folk with centrist and moderate tendencies.  America is our nation to win so long as we are peaceful and compassionate where appropriate.
We don't need to cuz we got Trump to take care of it now instead of someone useless
Look at how effective the violence was at spreading Milo's message, and generating interest in him. When Trump supporters turn the other cheek, the media has nothing to use against them, while viral news quickly spreads about violence against them.   When I see those videos, the instinctual part of me wants to be there, kicking some teeth in and fighting back. But the intelligent part of me is in control, and that's much more important. I am not an animal, like those on the left. 
Yes, do not let them push a fake narrative on us. 
Defend, but never provoke.    Never escalate the level of violence in the act of defense either.  
It really sucks, man. They want us to retaliate. And man oh man would I love to give one of those clowns a left hook to the chin... but that's not the right thing to do. WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH!
If they are calling for violence - They are HIGHLY suspicious for being tied to a SOROS NGO.
They are not apart of us. They are undercover impostors meant to try and take down this sub, just like they did with pizzagate and alt right. 
I have yet to see actual proof of conservative violence. The new conservative alt-right doesn't want the violence of the past we went through the Bush administration convinced that violence was the solution. To much of the base has seen the negativity and lack of results by use of force.    These people posting are not on our side they want flames, they want anarchy, they have no idea why they do it other then being told it's what they should do.  
Don't have time to retaliate. I'm working and living my life.
Learn the self defense laws of your state!
The shills are out in full force, here's a guy (along with another shill) who are astroturfing a thread in r/pics and spamming the same comments over and over.  https://www.reddit.com/user/happy_days_fonz  https://www.reddit.com/user/capoony147  It's safe to say they have begun shilling full force.  Report the comments, down vote them.  Call them shills, the people need to know they are being lied to and manipulated. 
I really, *really* hope that Jeff Sessions gives the police balls again. 
For once, an r/the_donald post I can proudly upvote. You guys produce a disgusting amount of shitposts, and pollute my (unfiltered) r/all front page with long, senseless and incredibly biased titles. And that's why I don't like you. But you're nowhere near as bad as them. You don't try to silence people, and you don't beat them senseless for having a different view.

Protect yourselves! That is IT.. Nothing more or less. If you're going to do something proactively, keep an eye out for trouble and use your best judgement to avoid it.  So far all the leftists have is "well the rioters are no different than the KKK that support drumpf lulz. Bad apples on both sides". For the life of me, I can't find an actual event where property was destroyed or people were hurt from the KKK (or supporting trump at all without him dissavowing it himself personally). Don't play into their hands and give them a fucking excuse.  As long as it's these retards rioting and the people equally retarded to refuse to condemn them on the left because "wel bof sydes does it?!?!" We win
Real power is in restraint, we all know it's us who would have the upper hand in any fight. The left are killing themselves with their violence, moderate liberals and people in the center of the political spectrum are alienated by it. They are handing us the moral high ground and potentially millions of votes.
Guaranteed it's Hillary trolls. Turn the other cheek and let them hang themselves.
Thanks for the reminder but it's pretty clear we don't need it. We're too busy MAGAing to waste time with that trash.
They are hoping to make us take the bait before Trump's cabinet is all in.
Where have these posts been? I often check Rising/New and haven't seen any calls for vitriol. Hopefully they're being immediately squashed.   To OP's point it's extremely suspicious given that most of T_D is anti-violence and enjoys laughing at the violent cucks on the left for being the delicate snowflakes they are.  Keep it classy, pedes
Any calls to action for violence from us would be fake as fuck. That should qualify for an auto-ban.
Even if it doesn't cause backlash, we shouldn't do it at all. We're better than that. We don't need to resort to violence to get our points across.  If you are in a position where you need to defend yourself, then yes, please do defend yourself, but don't actively go attacking people just because some of our fellow supporters are being attacked.
Being center myself, it really has become apparent that the left are the violent ones and the reason why it's pushed the majority right leaning. Brought it on themselves 
New strategy: Hold more right wing speeches in democratic states. That will show them how crazy liberals really are.
We have to be the change we want to see in America people. We should all be working together to achieve one big goal here. Regardless of how much they want to cry and riot and do what they do, we gotta be the bigger people and let it go. 
Self defense only fellow pepes!
They are looking to call the right, Trump supporters, and free speech activists violent. Don't give them that opportunity. 
This post is really nice. My political views may not align directly with this subreddit, but in a time of such a politically fractured country, I can respect the people who still function with reason and decency 
Soros and his wife's son are working overtime right now.
[deleted]    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2226   > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/04209)
Absolutely why would WE be violent?  ANNOYED to pieces YES but I am too busy and too nice to even think about hurting anyone.
Beware they want more incidents where police stand down to provoke Trump into sending the National Guard. This will lead to a martyrdom incident which would help their fake cause.  If anything what we need are brave anonymous citizen journalists filming everything, and a few even braver posing as Antifa to get even better damning footage.
I'm sorry, but we have to be vigilant.  We saw in Berkeley an attempted murder while cops were hiding.    I just think we should take steps to protect ourselves.    
Shit blue  putting in their hours
You are right. I personally find it very difficult to sit and watch them beat trump supporters without any consequences or retaliation but I'm sure their time will come. Antifa we're coming for you.
Look, honestly - I don't think the people on our side are like this. Sure there are some bad eggs, but we're smarter and actually care. I'm not worried 
Being a thug does not MAGA. 
I dont recommend people to hit back, they should make that decision themselves. But if i was hit by antifa, i would hit back and hard.
We have the best arguments. We don't need violence. All we need is AG Sessions to get confirmed and then it's checkmate leftists.
You want to hurt them, RECORD THEM AND HOLD THEM LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIMES THEY COMMIT.
Its just David Brock and his new group of super douchers trying to earn the penance.  Once they realize it wont work they will resort to paying some people to act like trump supporters and go out picking fights with a MAGA hat on.  Oh wait....that didnt work either.
Thanks for driving this point home! Dont't give into these agitators. We're better than those dip-shits!
/r/pics and /r/twoxchromosomes is censoring this photo from the liberal Trump protest. What a shame if this reached /r/all...
Everyone standing there not telling that fuckhead to put down that sign, is complacent and in agreement, fuck them. 
People will eventually die in those protests. I'm not desiring this but I have seen too many huge and violent protests across the world to predict this. It will probably be a innocent person, like a journalist. Mark my words.
Lol TwoX. Cannot tell if that subreddit is bunch of trolls or serious
I bet over at r/twoxchromosomes they were all ready and hyped up for Madame President.         **DENIED**
These protests will push so many people who leaned left to the right. They are destroying their own party with stuff like this. Hypocrites is all they are. No discussion, no arguments. All they do is throw buzzwords at you
[removed]
Twitter is saying its just one guy.  Excuse me.  He is surrounded by 100's of liberals all seeing this sign and they are doing nothing about it.    He should be arrested for soliciting a crime.
[deleted]
Damn, what the hell is wrong with people when they think that this is a display of righteousness? 
It took me a few seconds to realize the rainbow object in the picture isn't a fat person, it's just a hat. 
"Feminists"
**GET THIS TO THE TOP CENTIPEDES**
"We protect the rights of women. ... As long as they agree with us."
Disgusting people
To the bloody top with this! I want any SJW bleeding heart who backs the **paid** rabble to justify this **personally** to me - when is it **ever** okay to call for the rape of anyone?  You lost. Act like the adults you call yourselves and get over it.
Could you even fathom the outrage if someone rocked a "RAPE HILLARY" sign??
Outraged when this happens in their feminism narrative but gloating when it's a person they ''hate''
The tolerant left strikes again 
Its on Reddit rising now
This is the same subreddit who just a a few minutes ago had a thread about why asking your husband to be a cuck is a good thing. She claimed she gets her emotional fulfilment from her husband and her sexual fulfilment from her boyfriend. She also claimed their marriage is somehow better now.(it's not). 
Meanwhile Melania and Trump couldn't fucking care less
I'm so fucking tolerant bro.
WHO ARE THE REAL DEPLORABLES NOW HILLARY?!?!?!?!  
Get it to the top! Don't let the truth be censored
Soros needs to be sitting in a federal prison. 
I seriously do not understand how some peoples minds work. They did not get what they want so they resort to violence, on others to make the world less violent.   Every "liberal" I have chatted with justifies this by saying the same thing, "If the republicans lost they would be shooting and killing people." Alright that's fine to think but that is not what actually happening, they lost and they are the ones acting inappropriately.  As a 28 year old first generation Hispanic who supported Trump they tell me I am racist, and bigoted, "Oh your not Hispanic you were "raised white." I'm either colored or white depending on their mood and agenda for the day.  It's not ok that the tolerant left can behave like this and act this way. These protests need to be labeled as domestic terrorism and taken more seriously, they are damaging property and endangering American citizens. They represent racism, hate, bigotry, and want to do damage and harm to people for no reason.
Of course a hillary supporter would wear a hat that ugly 
These "protesters" are a disgrace.  
Aren't these the same people who have demanded laws requiring written consent before intercourse? Leftists are self serving and brain dead.
TBH, and this is coming from a non gun owner city of Chicago resident, albeit in the nice part where little crime happens - I see these "protests" and whatnot and think if there really was a civil war, who do these knuckleheads think will win?  The Left has the gang member types who don't vote, but they can utilize them as useful idiots, but they can barely shoot straight. The murder rate in Chicago would be 10X what it is now if these idiots knew how to shoot - thank goodness they don't, too.  But if it ever came down to it, did the legal gun owners who go to the range, and also do defensive shooting training, vote Hillary? Military vets. Did they vote Hillary? The militia types. Did they vote Hillary? The cops. Did they vote Hillary?  My point being this, and this is as a non gun owning Jew in Chicago - just who do these people think they can beat if it ever came down to war? Because that's exactly what they're calling for - a war.   And it would be a war they'd lose not just a little, but they'd lose badly - so badly there would be accusations of it being a genocide.   They need to be careful of their violence because sooner or later, people will get fed up and take them up on the offer. I hope that day never comes, but if it every does  I don't even want to think about it
I believe they call that a hypocrite 
GET THIS TO ALL
r/twoxchromosomes is probably the worst sub on reddit by far, in my opinion.  That place has me contemplate all the possible ways to suck start a shotgun, just to erase my mind what I have read there.
/r/twoxchromosomes is a militant feminist swamp what did you expect.
I know that's a hat, but imagine it as the balding guys's body.
There were some videos of Trump supporters getting their signs taken from them by brainwashed idiots and it made me mad.  Where were those people when we needed them?  Someone is openly advocating rape?  If ever there is a time to take someone's sign from them and rip it in half...  Why are liberals so violent?  Are they all just white knights?  Do they have an real values or opinions at all?
/r/twoXchromosones, more like /r/twoXtrachromosones
I have no doubt that they would drag his entire family into the streets and treat him like Gaddafi. Look at the way these people act and tell me you couldn't picture them doing this:  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=ee6_1319234557 (NSFW, very graphic)
Hypocritical left perpetuating what they hate the most.
When will people stop being blind and realize how truly hateful liberals are 
yummy leftist hypocrisy, almost as tasty as all the tears
 I hate that my first thought is this dude is collecting a paycheck for holding that sign 
*sigh* I guess it really is time to change my party affiliation from democrat to libertarian. Dammit guys, we were supposed to be the tolerant party 
Jesus Christ.
That sign is terrible, but I thought at first that bald guy had a giant tie dyed backpack, and I thought that was kind of cool.
Let the hate flow through you.   Let them show everyone what the regressive left really looks like. 
I mean I admit probably wrong place to say this I am no trump supporter  (or Hillary to be fair)   But they way hillary supporters have acted post election is sure as hell making them seem the bad ones 
[removed]
Let me qualify this by saying I'm a left leaning independent and I despised Trump...This is fucked up. I don't care who they are, I don't care what they do, I don't care what they believe, who they support, or who they know. Nobody fucking deserves that. If you're wishing something as terrible as that upon someone else, fuck you
Literally made an account just now after lurking here for the last several months because this pushed me over the edge and I wanted to do my part in getting it to /r/all
I live in Chicago and the number of protesting cucks the last few days is really starting to annoy the shit out of me. I swear to god I'm on edge, those protesters better stay the fuck away from me. 
Report this to the secret service. This is the First Lady being targeted. 
How can we be sure that photo is legit? Do we have other angles?
Wow....

I was wrong.  It looks like we have a rape culture after all.  kekekekekek
This is just like the arab spring they used in the middle east.  Let the people of the US see through this crap for what it is

That's a lot of tolerant liberals... 
This is absolutely disgusting 
twoxchromosomes is absolutely shameful lol. i'm glad some women can get some real support there, but the circlejerk they have going on about things they're totally ignorant about is insane. 
/r/twoxchromosomes? Oh that isn't surprising.  The vast majority of people there are extremely childish. And hate responsibility. Hence why they support abortions for any reason. Because they hate the responsibility of caring for a child. And they're all too stupid to use proper protection.
This is horrific. I don't have words. :(
What a fucking disgrace. Imagine if I said rape Michelle, I would be called racist
Totally thought it said RARE MELANIA.
So, fuck Clinton and Trump, but that's fucked up.
Such tolerance.
Don't worry Melania, we got your back
That would be a shame
Every time I've seen this I've wondered what that big multicolor blob was, just now realizing it's a hat
for shame r/2xc you are perpetuating rape culture
Those two subs are beyond cucked.
WTF
Disgusting fuckers
Such a nasty hat. No wonder it was censored.
I thought that was a pic of a HUUUUUGE FAT GUY wearing a tye-dye shirt. Hmmm... I definitely need glasses. It's time. 
Love TRUMPS rape
#TO THE TOP
i bet trump can call any of us up help him at any time he wanted. i think he knows its smarter to just let the salt evaporate- then prosecute
Wow. I obviously don't agree with the rioting, but at least I understand it. But this.... Just wow.

As a Russian,  I'm dying laughing from all this  "Google translate")))))   Way to go r/The_Donald! Сделаем Америку снова великой! (MAGA) 
RUSSIA FACT TIME!!!  The official name for Russia is the Russian Federation.  Russia shares borders with many countries, including China, Ukraine, North Korea and Norway.  In terms of land area, Russia is the largest country in the world.  Russia is located across 9 time zones.  At the beginning of 2013, Russia was estimated to have a population of around 143 million.  Russian is the official language of Russia but there are many other languages used in various parts of the country.  The capital and largest city in Russia is Moscow. Other major cities in Russia include Saint Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Novosibirsk.  Russians drive on the right-hand side of the road.  The currency used in Russia is the ruble.  Russia has a wide range of natural resources and is one of the world’s largest producers of oil.  The world’s first satellite, named Sputnik, was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957.  The Soviet Union (USSR) was a socialist state that occupied much of northern Asia and eastern Europe from 1922 until it was dissolved in 1991. Former Soviet states include Lithuania, Georgia, Latvia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and others.  The official residence of the Russian president is the Kremlin in Moscow. The name Kremlin means fortress.  Russia is one of 5 permanent members of the UN Security Council, along with the US, UK, China and France.  Russia has over 40 national parks and 100 wildlife reserves.  Lake Baikal is the largest freshwater lake in the world. It reaches 1642 metres (5,387 feet) in depth and contains around 20% of the world’s unfrozen fresh water.  Mount Elbrus is the highest mountain in Russia (and Europe), it reaches a height of 5642 metres (18,510 feet).  Russia’s Volga River is the longest in Europe, with a length of around 3690 kilometres (2293 miles).  Russia has the world’s largest area of forests.  Russia produces a large amount of renewable energy thanks to its well developed hydropower stations.
Russia, UK, and US.  The old gang is getting back together!
Look !. We Russia now !. I'm in, but only because I want a fur hat. I think I would look great in one. My name is now Nikita !. 
First they called us deplorables, then they called us racists, then they called us white nationalists, next they called us alt-right, now they're calling us Russians.    Call us whatever you want, we're still winners. MAGA!

I'm not a Trump supporter or a fan of this sub but this hypocrisy over the alleged Russian involvement in Trumps victory is driving me nuts. Foreign governments and special interests have been meddling with our democracy for years while the media remained silent. Saudis gave millions to the Clinton foundation. Now suddenly the Russians are evil because they supposedly hacked the DNC and revealed the disgusting truth about our democracy. They showed us the game is rigged against us. Hillary lost because she screwed over her own party, not because of Putin. Russia isn't perfect nor do they claim to be but they would make far better allies than the terrorist breeding shitholes we're friends with today. 
I love Russia, and I'd love to make a show of friendship with them, but this is still an American subreddit first and foremost! I'd rather keep our current winters theme. That could be vaguely Russian, too, couldn't it?
Well, I got my [dog prepared for the change!](http://i.imgur.com/egxnwRA.jpg)

I had this awesome, crazy uncle that told me amazing stories about all his travels.  He said, when he lived in Russia children under the age of five could not be seen in public unless they were dressed as little bears.  I totally believed that shit until I was in high school.  I also found out after he died that he'd never left the country.  But maaaan, he could tell the best stories full of details and intrigues! Anyway, if I ever have a kid, I'll be dressing him/her as a tiny Russian bear for the first 5 years of his/her life.  Because it's fucking awesome.  And it won't mess them up at all.  Right?

Guys I just talked to Putin and he admitted that he hacked the DNC to get Hillary the nomination because he knew Trump would beat her.  I think it's safe to say this is the beginning of the end of Trumps campaign
No one goes harder on ISIS than Putin....until Trump!

The Don has already warned that Russia is on notice. For some reason, the media just never believes him but everything he says comes true. Maybe they should give this guy a chance to truly reset Russian relations. Putin has already taken over two countries without a single response from Bush or Obama. If the response is we cannot do anything about it, then I bet Trump will have a real, practical solution that is in our interest -- the interest of freedom.
Everybody is upvoting all of Trump's kids except Barron. Shout-out to this computer expert!

He really knows cyber, folks! 
"Everything was by my design"  -Barron Trump
Kid looks exactly like him 
All I want is for him to come out and say "They are ripping us off on trade, folks."
BARRON TRUMP 2044 - SECURE THE GALACTIC EMPIRE
Weird to think about but has anyone actually heard Barron speak? 
Shout out to the based 6'0 10 year old.   Seriously, this kid is going to be taller than The Rock when he grows up.  
HE IS THE BEST AT CYBER, *THAT* I CAN TELL YOU!
My 7 year old sister met him at Trump's country club's Halloween event. He was very nice and didn't act like a brat like so many children there and he was dressed up as an army soldier. The entire family is just incredible.
This reminds me of a quote my professor told us before my Computer Security final.  > It was four-hundred pound hackers, not Russia, dad!  -Barron Trump

[deleted]
Anyone noticed that Melania keeps a tight watch on him? During the acceptance speech he was just sleepy but most of the time I see her giving him the "don't make me smack you, when we get home" look lol 😂 she's a good mom that's for sure. Keeps him in check and tries to keep him down to earth I'm sure. He's at a weird age though. A tough age. His siblings all turned out great so I'm sure he will be fine but I always think he looks like he's secretly a handful.   Edit: I bet he's the kind of kid you have to tell daily not to play soccer in the house lol
**CYBERLORD BARRON**
My thoughts and prayers to him.  His life is gonna get really weird now. 
We will all remember him as the sleepy little boy during Trump's victory speech but just watch. He'll be 6'6 and about to leave for college by the time Trump's term ends. 
People forget he is only 10 years old because he is so tall and mature looking. He was amazing at 3:30 am. What a well-behaved and stoic kid. Definitely not a whining, snowflake.
#Rumor has it this kid pwns in LOL and OverWatch. He fucks with Minecraft but only when he's really bored.
Based Barron, bet your bottom dollar he was out here shitposting with the rest of us. **GIVE THIS BOY A MEDAL!**
Strapping young man. Kid is 10 years old and like 5' 8. Super model mom and billionaire father whos now the most powerful man on earth. Safe to say he has a bright future
Barron "4chan" Trump!
This kid knows cyber
I found Barrons YouTube Channel!  https://youtu.be/IukTiqAqVBM
Everyone's favorite cyberer 
Anyone not using "p@ssword" as their password is a computer scientist in DC. This kid is a computer legend.
Rumor has it Baron is the source of all the leaks. He's an expert with the cyber.
50th POTUS Barron Trump!
This guy understands cyber, folks 
He really resembles his dad in younger years.
I bet he has vast venom storage and little to no control of how much venom is injected per bite. Or is it just baby snakes who can't control their venom release? 
And he cuts a sharp figure in that suit, too!
He looks most like young donald
Top Russian hacker!!!!
Kids gonna get sooo much pussy

I hear he's quite good with cyber
Our little prince! It was so late I was surprised he held up! Great job Barron! Give this patriot a coat!

 Hey /u/moonlightsugar,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.

**¿¿¿Could this be the young Meme Jedi foretold by the KeK Masters???**
Barron, should I use Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox? 
What a dapper little gentleman. 
Fun fact: this kid knows more about computers than a former Secretary of State and two-time Presidential candidate. And that wasn't some 1800s era candidate, that was Hillary freakin' Clinton! Man, this kid's good!
Based coding lord of dimensions
He is very good with the cyber. 
Is he the Russian hacker who stole all of HRC's emails??!?

He's gonna be a good looking dude when he grows up
is he the hacker known as 4chan
His dad isn't even in office yet, and it's obvious he is going to be the greatest First Minor ever. Really, smart. Really Great. The Best. 
Be nice to Barron. He's going to be the next president!
Gorgeous kid looks just like his dad
He really looks like something like a genius Hungarian who migrated to develop the architect the new computing system or something right there.

Barron is a collective reincarnation of all the shamans of Neolithic humanity's various peoples, the first human psykers. The foul Moloch entities that would become the four Great Powers of Chaos had not yet fully formed when the future Emperor was born on Earth during prehistoric times, somewhere in ancient central Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 8th Millennium B.C. But even before the birth of the future Emperor, as humanity grew and progressed, the Warp began to become increasingly disturbed by the dark undercurrents of humanity's collective psyche, and the shamans began to lose their former ability to reincarnate into new bodies. Instead, upon dying, their souls were being consumed by the entities and daemons of the Warp. Eventually the shamans of humanity, unable to reincarnate, would become extinct, and without the shamans and their psychic abilities to guide the race, humanity would inevitably fall prey to the corruptions of Chaos, just as eventually happened to the Bushes. In these ancient days, all the shamans of Earth gathered in a grand conclave to decide what must be done to stave off the day when they had all been consumed by the Warp..... it was here they decided to put their souls together into one physical body ...
We have got the cyber covered, folks.
god he is adorable.
Secretary of Cyber!
I'm very excited to have a young man in the white house. He will be the little prince of America for the next four years. In a country that was leaving young men behind, it'll be good to have some attention on our future Men. 
That's a good looking kid.
I wonder how the President Elect feels knowing there's a literal army of shitposters just waiting for the inevitable coronation of his son as their emperor. 
The real hero of the night for staying up so late and catching himself during the acceptance speech. A true champion.   We love you Barron!
Poor Barron, why couldn't they just move him to the other side of Melania if they were also going to torture him by keeping him awake at what, based on his appearance, was clearly fifteen hours past his bedtime?  **BARRON LOVES THE CYBER, HE'S THE BEST AT IT, BUT HE ALSO NEEDS HIS SLEEP, GUYS!**
i felt so bad for him at Trump's acceptance speech.  He was falling asleep standing up.  ive got a 4 year old and I know what kids look like when theyre trying like hell to stay awake but just can't do it.  hope he enjoys being a First Kid.
I can already tell that he is going to be incredibly good looking guy when he's older 
He's the first son in the white house sonce John F Kennedy Jr.
I bet he's done so many 360 no scopes on the computer. 
Tell me his middle name is "Von"
I like to think Barron's not actually THAT good at computers, but Donald, being a 70-year-old man, saw him typing HTML or something and was blown away.  Hey, my grandpa does the same thing x)
It is clear that in addition to mastering time travel, 4D chess, interstellar wormholes etc, Donald has also mastered cloning. This Donald Trump II prototype will be ready to take over when the Madman retires at age 130.
Is he the hacker known as FOUR CHAN?

These people are sociopaths. They walk in to work every day and realize that they mean nothing. They do not contribute to anything and do not do anything other than suck funds off the government teet via lobbying. They even list themselves as lobbyists on their taxes.  At least wall street brokers have to work for those commissions. These guys are nothing more than corrupt oligarch check collectors, the same as communist party members taking money from their local government to build their next sauna in the 1970s.
I don't know who Soros is Soros-ing anymore.  
What did you expect? This is Shillary at her finest
Mutual disdain for Hillary Clinton is probably the best thing I see on reddit everyday, can't wait for the election to end, no one will protect her when she has no political power to leverage.
Is there any piece of political corruption Hillarys name isn't tied to!?!??? Like COME ON. How can someone be THIS close to so much crap and not have some shit on their hands!??
Most people haven't even heard of the panama papers so this doesn't even matter.
**GET HER OUT!! OUT OUT!!**
I like turtles
Conservative radio should pick it up, but no way in hell MSM or print even attempts to mention this. Remember, Shillary has a campaign budget that exceeds $1 billion. The amount of $$$ she spends on advertising is in the 100's of millions, much of which goes to Time Warner, Comcast, CBS Corp, Disney, Viacom. These companies own 80% of what we see and hear, and all of them love Shillary. Reporting anything negative or damaging to Clinton will never be allowed, she is their best customer right now, revenues are through the roof. I would be embarrassed to call myself a journalist today, a Stenographer is the correct title.  Report negatively towards Shillary, and you don't have a job. This is Fact!      
## **STRAIGHT TO THE TOP OF R/ALL, UPVOTE THIS!**
Not surprised 
The corrupt MSM probably won't mention this. They don't call it Clinton News Network for nothing   This is why the RNC should start supporting Trump, he would absolutely destroy Hillary
Holy crap...wonder why I am not surprised. Hildabeast teaches her sycophant's well

This link is pretty tenuous and does nothing to suggest he had any knowledge of wrongdoing.
Well, I guess if someone's name is implicated in the Panama papers, it's enough to have them leave the race, right? Are you certain you're willing to take that stand. Just sayin
Not surprised.  How long until we hear her invoke the "overzealous staffer" excuse?

It's fucking laughable how many times I see this bitch involved in a scandal or crime, yet every time a shotgun blast of truth hits her in her rotting jack o lantern-esque face, she heals like the T1000.
The republicans need to unite behind trump ASAP so we can PIVOT and use HIGH ENERGY to tear CLINTON apart.

#THERE WILL BE BARELY A PEEP ABOUT THIS IN MAINSTREAM MEDIA. YOU JUST WATCH.
Lets hope this has more legs than the Cruz sex scandal, source is a bit sketchy.
Look. I despise hillary. But do any of you honestly think this will end her campaign? 
The only two candidates in America today that are not beholden to financials masters are Trump and Bernie. America, please put these two men into the gladiator arena. All other candidates don't deserve to be in the same company.   What I don't understand is how Bernie became a communist without being cucked into it by Soros. Very perplexing.

Hasn't even left Trump Tower for the Oval office yet. Meanwhile Lame Duck has cancelled another pipeline.
Not even president yet. Someone better get Obama some crayons and a therapy dog, STAT!
Trump is unique, im not American and yet he amazes me, he really wants to make america great again. No talking, **STRAIGHT UP ACTION**.  He never stops.
Can we just put Pence in the White House and let Trump run the country from high atop Trump Tower?  There's just something so supremely satisfying in seeing people, especially enemies like Romney and Al Gore have to take those Golden Elevators up to the Halls of the Trumpen King. 
I am legitimately surprised at the stuff he's done. Trump is barely PRESIDENT ELECT and he's already delivering on numerous promises! That, friends, is what gives me hope that the next eight years will be absolutely beautiful.
This man will go down in history as one of the greatest leaders to ever walk this Earth.
I'M WAITING TO SEE HOW **CNN** IS GOING TO TELL ME THIS IS **BAD**
Obama complained about not having a magic wand. Apparently that magic wand is giving a shit and making an effort.

The madman is already winning so hard and he hasn't even started receiving his paychecks yet (of $1 per year)
Trump is playing 69d interdimensional korean starcraft.   Purposely does small 1k jobs deal with Carrier.  Watch Fake News turn it up to 11 just to try and downplay the deal.   Then when Fake News still recovering from outrage,  he drops this fucking nuke of a deal. 50k more jobs deal, now Fake News already spent their load on fake outrage over the Carrier deal,  and now America is primed for the real Winning, with this deal.

Is this Specific to Sprint? I'm pretty sure they have lots of other investment they would want to do.  Either way, I'm happy to be a Sprint user, time for Pede's to get on-board.  (Verizon and AT&T are both globalist, so you may as well)

Trump is absolutely smashing it! He is a good man do good things. Keep winning and everyone will see it!  
Wow that is awesome. I swear Trump is looking to be a president that actually does something for the people. I really hope I do get tired of winning, it would be nice instead of losing! I can't wait to see how the media says this is a bad thing somehow.
I'm literally crying tears of joy.  Never have I seen a man so passionate, so efficient, and so great at what he does. This is AMAZING! Trump IS the savior of the west

This is new territory. Business leaders respect Trump as one of them, not some egghead politician who doesn't understand how jobs and money are made.  They crave his respect. They want his praise.
I am without words. Such a hardworking and productive man. He has already done more, than Obama could ever accomplish.

As a Japanese, I first feared that this could stunt the growth of the Softbank group as a whole.   But then again, Mr. Son has probably seen the Don's insane skill in tactical business decision making, and was completely sold on what he proposed, 100% sure that nothing bad will happen.   Keep it up Don!

How will the libtards spin this?
How will they spin this as bad
American companies FTW
inb4 bernie sanders either takes credit (if he thinks it is good) or proclaims doomsday (if he thinks it is bad)
And fuck Verizon.  Gotta get me some Sprint.
Welfare recipient Democrats and millennial basement dwellers triggered.
As a former sprint customer, i hope this means better infrastructure. I would love to go back but their network sucks balls.
I live in OP and have had Sprint my entire life. Maybe they can use some of that money to give the Sprint customers living here full coverage across the city, because it is BAD. It's quite ironic. BUT YAY FOR JOBS. MAGA.
If only my country had half as good as a president like Trump.... would you welcome a poor, but hard-working Serbian historian in the US? I had 3 courses about US history!
DONALD TRUMP IS "TIME" PERSON OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!
[deleted]
He should've won that Emmy. Well, there's still TIME.
Biggest no brainer in history.  I'm struggling to think of a single other instance where one person dominated the world's attention so completely for a whole year.  Freaking Hitler is the last example I can think of.   (ZOMG TRUMP = HITLER CONFIRMED)
I'm actually surprised. He was overwhelmingly the person who should have won. What he accomplished with all the forces against him is amazing. I'm surprised that cucked rag actually awarded it to him.
Watch the video on Time's website announcing it (Drudge has a link). It's super-cucky. They can't help themselves. Almost apologizing for making an obviously-right choice. They certainly throw the bone to their SJW base (President-Elect of the Divided States of America....Is his Influence for Good or Ill....) 
Trump tweeted it out 10 minutes early
Hahaha can't wait for the left to call Times a clear white supremacists rag
HRC loses again!!!  Let's take a trip down HRC's impressive losing career:  ✅ Failed DC Bar  ✅ Failed as First Lady (healthcare, Janet Reno/Waco massacre, literally being a cuck)  ✅Only won Senate race because her opponent died (*referencing JFK jr who planned on running as a democrat in the primary, not Rudy)- likely caused by her  ✅Accomplished nothing of note in her Senate career - even failed to pass a bill she cosponsored to make flag burning illegal  ✅ Failed 2008 presidential candidate  ✅ Failed Secretary of State (Ben Ghazi, Libya, ISIS, literally bought and paid for by entities hostile to the U.S., responsible for the biggest intelligence leak in U.S. History)  ✅ Failed 2016 presidential candidate - lol  ✅ Failed recount of 2016 election - pending  ✅ Clinton Foundation donations drying up in response to her lost political influence  ✅ Loses time person of the year to Trump  ✅ Failed as a human being(?Not sure if she even qualifies as human)  Literally her whole life is failure.    Edit: flat to flag  Double edit : clarified about JFK Jr not Rudy
#MADLAD OF THE YEAR
Did anyone read the article? It's a hit piece from a trash magazine.
Makes you wonder if they would have used the phrase "Divided States of America" and focused so much on a "divided nation" had Hillary won.. since the circumstances would have been more or less the same.   Lulz who am I kidding, of course they wouldn't.
[deleted]
Let another triggering commence!
Brace yourself for libs to cry that he only one due to his "controversial nature." Please. We all know he won for Making America Great again
I bet hilldog is already calling for a recount 
[deleted]
Reading Time's reasoning for "why he won" he reads something like "well he represents the worst in America, and Hillary would be have totes awesome, but I guess we have to give it to him because he won"  I wouldn't give them too much credit.  From their perspective, it's probably like when they gave Adolf Hitler "Person of the Year" in 1938
Did anyone also read the article.  Pure fucking salt.
That's just one more thing I can relate to our future president on. We've both been Time's Person of the Year!
TIME SUBREDDIT OF THE YEAR - /r/The_Donald
It's another hit piece.  Fuck the Times...they are irrelevant.
Calm down centipedes, Stein just filed for a recount.
Should have been Assange.  But of course they wouldn't do that.  At least they didn't pick some stupid ass SJW or some shit that they had as the other options.  Time will just use this as an opportunity to bash Trump with a hit piece.
Haha. Fuck you Reddit! Fuck you /r/[redacted]!
How will CNN spin this? I'll start.   *Did Trump rig TIME's voting process?*
Sell your salt stocks folks, the Hillary supporters are about to flood the market.
WERE REACHING LEVELS OF WINNING THAT SHOULDNT EVEN BE POSSIBLE 
Who wants to bet r/politics will be having a total meltdown today?
More important who is Breitbart's Person of the Year?
Remember, liberals. If you're comparing Trump to Hitler because they both won the Time's Person of the Year, then you're comparing Hitler to every US President since since 1927 (except Coolidge, Hoover and Ford), pacifists and civil rights activists, our troops and scientists, the baby boomers, the people who fought off ebola, the Queen, French leaders, Hungarian revolutionaries, web entrepreneurs, the Middle Americans, computers, our own planet, popes, scientists who helped research AIDS, every American woman (like Hillary), the Apollo 8 crew, the CEOs of Intel and Amazon.com, the Mayor of New York City, the founder of Facebook, the chairman of the Federal Reserve who lead us through the 2007-08 financial crisis, whistleblowers, and most importantly, your supposed qualities: the "good samaritan", the "peacemaker", YOU.  Replace Trump with any one of those people and think of all the shit you'd get. "Oh, so the people who fought ebola won the Time's Person of the Year award? Well, so did Hitler!"

Lets hope he doesn't win twice. like Stalin, Obama, and WJC.  Make sure to remind the cucks of this when Hitler pops up. Khomeini made an appearance once too
I'm tired of winning 
#Person of the decade
[It's real. All of it.](http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2016-donald-trump/)
Can't wait for the article showing how he was Person of the Year in the same way Hitler or Pol Pot would have been.
Sadly, the article will have a very negative spin, you can count on it. Just another way to bash him and make Hitler parallels. Oh well still winning, F Time!

The Nobel Prize committee is meeting to repossess Obama's Nobel and give  it to Donald.
Jesus, they are still salty as fuck!  I love every bit of it lol
"Clinton now the first person in history to end in second place in both person of the year and president" says a comment. "Don't forget the primaries, too" says I
Still not tired of winning. Praise Kek!
I'm just going to post this in the hopes of staving off a lot of misinformation.  Nobody 'wins' person of the year. It is not an award. It is who Time believes had the largest impact on the global Zeitgeist, for good or for ill.   It was Merkel last year because of her massive immigration blunder that has turned parts of Europe into a third world shit hole. If you want to see just how bad it is, go to http://voat.co/v/european . Not exactly an accolade.   In 2001 it was going to be Osama Bin Laden until ignorant people started lighting torches and buying pitchforks.  You can argue that someone else had a greater impact this year, but considering how Trump is the anti globalist poster boy that is inspiring front nationale, AfD, Brexit and many other anti globalist movements, he's ostensibly  the best choice.  
"PRESIDENT OF THE DIVIDED STATES OF AMERICA"   ...pathetic MSM. They want the division and are responsible for it.   Do you really think it would say "PRESIDENT OF THE DIVIDED STATES OF AMERICA" on the cover if Hillary had won ?...of course not.  Fuck the Time. 
ctr once again btfo. 
"President of the Divided States of America" is a perfect phrase to describe Trump.  Obama caused a sharp division in our country and Trump is now the president of that divided country and will hopefully be able to mend it.
They still took the opportunity to slander him in every paragraph, photograph him and his crew in desaturated DARK tones, subtitle those pictures with far-left talking points, promote ALREADY disproven hate-crime HOAXES, and of course cherry pick bad behavior from supposed Trump supporters. All the while reminding you he has NO STRATEGY and is improvising....what a FUCKING JOKE of a hit piece. This is blunt propaganda.
Did they have to put him in a frayed chair in the picture?  With a scowl on his face?  I hate Time.

#**CRACK OPEN THE CHAMPAGNE LADS, THE TIME TO STOP WINNING IS NEVER**
inb4 "Hitler was time person of the year so this is only fitting" comments
Fuck Time. When their pick does not win, they call it the Divided States of America.  When their pick wins, we are united. Cuck superemes. Fuck them. 
Whomever wrote the article is a complete atrocious shill for Hillary. 
*divided* states jesus these bitches still can't find a way to hide their salt!
The wins just keep stacking on top of eachother, I'll never get tired of winning.
THE LIBERAL TEARS ARE REACHING CRITICAL MASS!
Cucks on /r/politics all crying "so did Hitler" lmao
He wins - we win! 
They had no choice but to give it to him - the only other option was Assange and no way did they want to legitimize all the uncomfortable truths found in the wikileaks....2017 will not be fun for them, though.  But it's an acidic, salty attack on Trump just the same - predictably so - and they waste no time in the first paragraph:  >Even for Donald Trump, the *distance* is still fun to think about, up here in his penthouse 600 ft. in the sky, where *it’s hard to make out the regular people below*. The ice skaters swarming Central Park’s Wollman Rink look like old-television static, and the Fifth Avenue holiday shoppers could be *mites in a gutter*.  Yeah....he's completely distanced from the common folk who live in the gutter below him.  That's the subtle message they try to send right away.  They could have mentioned that Trump himself fixed the Central Park skating rink years back after bungling and incompetence left it a complete mess (on his own dime, no less) but no....not on their watch!  Stay classy, Time...  >In the weeks after his victory, **hundreds** of incidents of harassment—against women, Muslims, immigrants and racial minorities—were reported across the country using his name.  Oh really.....can we get a fact check on that, Hannity?  And they try to create the appearance of fairness with bits like this:  >But Obama never fully delivered the prosperity he promised. There was certainly help on the margins, slowing cost growth for health care and providing insurance to millions, for example. He started some pilot projects for manufacturing hubs, increased incomes marginally in the past couple of years and led the nation to recover from a vicious recession, with the federal government directly creating or saving millions of jobs. An unemployment rate that peaked at 10% in October 2009 has been halved to 4.6% now, at the end of his term. But the great weather systems of global change continued under his watch. Ultimately, he grew resigned to the fact that there was only so much he could do in office.  So....how exactly did he *lead* the country out of a massive recession?  Extending the volatile short-term practice of quantitative easing through the Fed for EIGHT years has left the US and global economy on the brink of collapse.  They had no clue and just masked a problem that is now so much worse, almost to the point where it can never be fixed.  And the only way he "halved" the unemployment rate was to redefine how that stat is calculated.  When things get so bad that people stop looking for work...and you DON'T count those people in your unemployment statistics, you're announcing fake numbers.  Kind of like that "3 million deported" figure which now includes people who are turned away at the border...how do you "deport" someone who hasn't even entered the country yet?  I can imagine them telling people "cross this yellow line.....and take a step back" to make it official(ly ludicrous).  >Ultimately, he grew resigned to the fact that there was only so much he could do in office.  That's rich.  I don't think there's ever been a president that did LESS than Obama.  The only issues that ever seemed to catch his interest were photo-ops with A listers, opportunities to widen the racial divide ("if I had a son..."), and co-opting every tribute to an important historical figure or event ("a bride at every wedding...a corpse at every funeral").  It was always about you, Barry, and never about the American people.  The fact that your "legacy" needs to be erased on Day One (and can be done so easily) is all you have to show for 8 years overseeing the demise of America - for you, that's mission accomplished!
Glorious!

# **THE WINNING NEVER STOPS!**
Wikipedia : "However, Time magazine points out that controversial figures such as Adolf Hitler (1938), Joseph Stalin (1939 and 1942), Nikita Khrushchev (1957), Ayatollah Khomeini (1979), and Donald Trump (2016) have also been granted the title for their impacts. In 1999, the title was changed to Person of the Year."   wikipedia left wing bias? whatever could you mean?
Of course they couldn't even be respectful. Look at the cover. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CzEuR4IXUAArY_r.jpg  .  "President of the DIVIDED States Of America" I wonder if they would have phrased it that way if Hillary had won.  What a disrespectful thing to parody the name of the country like that and disrespect the President. 
Yet and they still make the subtle dig of saying "President of the Divided States of America" Fucking salty assholes.
BUT HE'S SO RACIST REEEEEEEEEEE
Thoughts on the article?   I thought it was pretty unbiased and accurately showed why Trump won.   Trump was the only candidate who genuinely gave a shit about the working class. His message is about helping working class citizens get back the quality of life their parents and grandparents had. We've all seen politicians express this message, but they cannot do so without a teleprompter in front of them, making them come off as phony (which they are). At Trump's rallies, he would talk on stage for an hour and a half with no script (except on a few occasions during the last few weeks of the general election) like it was just you and him together in that room. He'd make jokes, share stories and engage the audience all while getting his message across. You can't do that at multiple different rallies each day with no script on his schedule without actually giving a shit.   In short, Trump cares about the working class so he was able to sincerely address their concerns, and the article got that point across.   
Hitler once used a watch to tell time and now President-Elect Trump is on the cover of a magazine called "Time". Coincidence? I think not. /s
Plates of chicken nuggets are flying across rooms all over the country after this news went out.
In before the liberals start saying "Yeah, well Hitler was person of the year once too"
Still not tired of winning 
We were a part of this centipedes! MEME MAGIC IS REAL.

Nice. They basically wrote an anti Trump propaganda piece to accompany it though so I won't praise them too much.

>Divided States  I hate that part. It just fuels division more than unity. The only "division" are liberal snowflakes crying over a democratic election. 
Much more of an accomplishment than Obama's Participation Trophy er... i mean Nobel Peace Prize.
Of course he is.  He fucking won.  He destroyed the lying media.  He destroyed Crooked Hillary.  He destroyed the Dishonest DNC.  He destroyed the wretched establishment.  He is the MAN OF THE YEAR!
Even though it's another fearmongering hit piece by a liberal rag, I'm still happy that they had to cancel all the HRC articles they wrote back in January because "it's her turn!" and "Trump has no chance!"
anyone tired of winning yet? I'm sure not

I love the police, and have a great respect for what they do.  That being said, there are bad apples in every bunch...which is why they get a lot of hate, especially from minorities.  I've had good experiences with police, and I've had some terrible ones.  Crazy fuck high on meth is threatening to kill you, your girlfriend, and waving a hammer in the face of your neighbors after stealing $700 worth of gear from their shed?  Nothing we can do.  Your Mexican, but legal citizen, friend calls someone a bastard after they almost hit him with their car?  Sending a squad car right away.  I do live in an area divided though.  Half is super high cost of living, the other half is shitty neighborhoods mostly populated by people who only speak Spanish.

A Las Vegas police officer was arrested after arriving at an abortion clinic on Ranchero Dr. where Christians were blocking the entrance in an attempt to protect the preborn from a brutal death. Rather than join the other officers in arresting the Christians, however, officer Chet Gallagher joined the blockade by sitting down with the Christians blocking the entrance.  Officer Gallagher later stated: “I have the sworn responsibility to protect human life. It alone is the highest call and most important duty of every commissioned peace officer. The protecting of human life is the priority that must be considered over less significant property and personal rights of others. Therefore I exercise my discretion as a commissioned law enforcement officer, choosing not to arrest these rescuers, but standing with them in their attempt to prevent certain death to unborn children.”

I think this is why Jennifer Palmieri warned Hillbots about "whopper" wikileaks in next two days. She knows the non-corrupt FBI agents are going to go batshit leaking dirt after Comey's second cuck-out. 
No one is fooled.  They just added fuel to the fire...
5 Things every voter should know:  1. Clinton Foundation is still under investigation for some potentially horrible crimes, including human trafficking of children 2. HRC campaign PAID PEOPLE to incite violence at Trump rallies (who were since fired). Why would a campaign need to hire fake protestors in the first place? 3. Hillary is involved in some weird #SpiritCooking rituals, which look a lot like satanic orgies 4. Hillary said she wants OPEN BORDERS and Free College Tuition, which sound great on paper but the combination would make America broke. Who would pay for all that!? YOU WOULD.  5. If you want to discredit WikiLeaks without looking at the reporting, you shouldn't criticize climate change deniers who refuse to look at the science. It's the same thing. Don't be a fucking hypocrite. 
I am so unbelievably angry right now.  I've been reading just a fraction of some of the leaked emails.  There is STRAIGHT UP PROOF that the DNC was corrupt and rigging everything to get Bernie kicked out of the race, straight up proof of Hillary hosting confidential info on a server on her property, and even one about her maid printing off said information.  She also forwarded marked emails to her daughter, leaving the private network entirely.  If I saved ONE email from my work on a personal device and got caught, I'd never see another IT position in my life.  She's walking away scott free after hosting an entire server.  Just... good God.  WHAT THE FUCK.  But don't point any of this out anywhere else on reddit, else your comment is removed, you get banned, or worst of all get hundreds of downvotes and idiots insulting you while they don't take a few moments to do their own research.  Fucking hell.
Democrats earlier this year: We love Comey, he is the greatest  Democrats last week: We hate Comey, he must resign  Democrats today: Comey is the greatest.  Seems like a relationship with that girlfriend who always starts fights and you break up every few weeks but then get back together for a bit and it happens again.

The FBI has an amazing track record under the Clintons https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_siege
Exactly. Everyone needs to forget the Comey thing. It's all part of the dems script. Comey was ordered to re-open and then close it today to give Clinton the last thrust. It's like Trump says..."It's all rigged and corrupt." They are shitting their pants pulling out all stops because of the impending wave of Trump votes. #PLEASE MAGA TUESDAY - GO VOTE.  #IGNORE THIS COMEY STUFF IT IS SCRIPTED FROM THE START
Rigged system, folks
That was HillDawg's attempt to play 3D-Chess. This is gonna backfire real bad.
Well, I hope those FBI agents that were all about to hand in their resignations if he didn't reopen the case step down on Monday morning. It's time for people to start putting money where their mouth is. The election is Tuesday. I'll never forget who the cowards were.
It takes 10,000 weaponized autists a whole day to go through 3000 wikileak  Podesta emails. Does the FBI really think they have more spectrum than the_donald and 4chan? The fuck they do.
Just fuck my country up, fam
I am a wise old fuck. Pay attention pedes. You will only hear about this newest Comey thing from those who are voting for her anyway. 36 hours from Nov. 8th  is too late for Hillary to pick up one more vote. MSNBC CNN ABC CBS NBC Yahoo News Huffpost can giggle and fart all they want tonight. America will be watching NFL and Housewives of Whateverville. Monday they will watch NFL and Voice.   All the votes are already cast in absentee and mail-in/early voting and in the minds of those voting in person. Its OVER ALREADY.  Trump won it in a LANDSLIDE. Blue union collar Reagan Dems, 20% of the African American and 40% of the Hispanic vote. High R and low D turnout compared to 2012. Millennials stayed home as expected. Worried liberal moms crossed over. Millions of Evangelicals who stayed home for Romney voted Trump. Sanders back lash.
They were *so* thorough...
Now that I think about it, this whole fiasco was really to help Klanton.  By reopening the case, they put up the illusion of "double checking" her emails. Clearing her twice was a scheme to reassure voters that she's clean.  Rigged.  Deleted tens of thousands of emails in violation of federal records keeping. Classified information for people without security clearances to see (now, including her maid). Email correspondences showing us that she deliberately set up the server to avoid FOIA requests. Skipped ethics training and ignored repeated warnings about using personal accounts to conduct business. Lousy testimonies from her and her cronies. They had all of this pinned on her, but they didn't charge her on any of it. They gave a stupid ass reason too: "lack of intent." The rest of us would have been serving 20 years minimum in prison with only a fraction of the evidence presented.   They bypassed all normal protocols too. No grand jury convened. Immunity deals for everybody involved. All remaining evidence destroyed by the feds, which means no one can watch the watchmen.  That's why I doubted they would do anything different this time around. Reopening the case made no sense when they ignored every single red flag (and there were many) the first time.  But now I see right through it. It only makes sense if it was designed to help Klanton. **I bet they reopened it so they could neuter Trump's rigged system/double standards talking points towards the final stretch.** Guess what all headlines and TV shows are going to be about on the last day before election? Klanton cleared. CNN already has it as their main headline on their website. In addition to that, Trump spent much of last week talking about how she's under investigation, and now he looks to be discredited. And Klanton will get sympathy votes for being seen as a victim of a witch hunt.
#DRAIN THE SWAMP!!!
Intellectually, I knew this would happen. Now the same liberals who complained about the FBI will tout the exoneration of Hillary by such a fine agency. Since we KNOW voting fraud has and will occur, with the complicit MSM setting the pre-determined outcome narrative, I fear even our likely Trump landslide will be quashed by the most corrupt administration in history. Much more than I would have guessed, my reaction to this expected result is I am fucking furious.
I sort of had the feeling when they opened up the second investigation that they would close it and clear Hillary before the elections to use it as another propaganda tool.
I have no faith in the FBI anymore. Fucking joke organisation. Department of Justice? Fuck them. The whole system is rotten to the core. If there are good people in it, they are the minority. Either fighting an uphill struggle, or being intimidated by corrupt thugs.  If these organisations let evil prosper, they are either cowards, corrupted, or complicit in the crime.  #Justice Be Done Though The Heavens Fall.
All while over half their agents were busting an underage human trafficking ring as well! Impressive!

Crooked through and through. Only one thing left to do. DRAIN THE SWAMP!
#DrainTheSwamp
Damage was done last week. This just looks bad all around and will be pounced on tomorrow by Trump's campaign. Outside the echo chamber people are tired of the bullshit and this is a prime example.  I wouldn't be surprised to see a wikileaks money shot tomorrow.  Remember: both campaigns have focused hard on "blue states" thus weekend. Very telling.  Tuesday night will be interesting.
One of these headlines is going to be the shot heard around the world. 
Release them then! We'll have a look ourselves.
The FBI has handled this case so damn poorly. 
DAMMIT Rush Limbaugh was right.  This was all a ruse to clear Hillary a couple of days before the election to try to boost her numbers.  Rush was right.
All of r/all is celebrating her getting off again, literally they're celebrating that their presidential candidate skated prison again. Really forces you to ponder.

Comey is a coward. NYPD needs to hold that press conference and leak what they have now.
Why the fuck is hillarys subreddit in r/all?
With all this blatant corruption I am deeply concerned about what is going to happen in a few days. The writing seems to be on the wall in a serious way that the people, in large numbers, are not pleased. 
Lol, I'm sorry, you're telling me that a) none of what we found was important and b) you went through those emails faster than 10,000 of us? 
To be fair, 33,000 emails were in paper and were scanned in a very poor quality format hence took 12 months to go through. But even with that, I don't believe that the FBI has gone through 650,000 emails electronically. I think Comey did this to buy time to prevent leaks from the NYPD and the FBI, which isn't much time now prior to the election. :/
Because they had them the whole time.
[removed]
The FBI were ONLY investigating the E-MAILS. NYPD were investigating the Clintons for the Epstein/Child abduction case and FBI had no jurisdiction on the kiddie fiddling. I reckon the FBI just got themselves out of NYPD's way, for New Yoik's finest to make arrests. Giuliani will have the skinny on this, wait for his comments before writing all of this off.
it's amazing if you think about it: right now in south korea they are in the streets, protesting against their president for corruption.  and somehow, half of america is completely ok with their democratic candidate cheating to beat another candidate (bernie), getting caught using their own party to unfairly win (DNC and debbie), getting caught being leaked debate questions (CNN, brazile), covering up data, deleting information after a subpoena was issued (30000 "yoga emails"), and the list goes on and on.  it kinda reflects america as a whole.  banks get away with bullshit, noone riots, noone cares.  they get away with it.  in other countries there would be an uprising for the things these people do.  why is america too afraid to hold their leaders accountable?  even people like obama, trick the people into thinking he is their best friend, and he decides to fuck them all over with a subpar health care system that is getting a huge increase in cost once he leaves office...how convenient!  thanks barack, not that you would care, you are rich and can afford it regardless.  but those people who cant afford it?  the ones getting *fined* for *not being able to afford insurance*?  they are the ones who suffer.  cause you lied about giving all americans good health care.  whether you like trump or not, is irrelevant.  people need to be held accountable when they lie, or break rules.  and getting away with breaking rules because you have powerful friends is not ok either.  why is edward snowden a fugitive?  cause he exposed what the government was doing illegally, he blew the whistle.  but since the government is above the law, much like hillary clinton this election, they can break the rules and get away with it.  and the guy questioning the rule breaking is still liable for breaking rules.  CNN used to criticize al jazeera for being "propaganda".  but what have they given america this entire election cycle?  nonstop bias and one sided story telling.  even the "republican pundits" were criticizing trump.  everything has a distinct slant, from day 1.  now how could a reputable news organization get away with this?  surely, the news cant be bought?  until you realize CNN is owned by time warner, the same time warner who contribute to her campaign.  and go down the list of media outlets, you'll find a steady link of contributions either from the foundation or to clinton.  but whatever.  I honestly don't care at this point.  if america wants to elect a puppet for banks then let them.  but when the bubble pops (and we are in one, look at stock market trends), dont expect hillary to save you.  she is only going to help her friends at goldman sachs.  you?  you are noone.  and if you think hillary cares about your interests then I have a massive obamacare price increase to tell you about.
Rudi Giuliani and the NYPD won't let them get away with it all. Rudi called it all last week and I'm expecting New Yoik's finest to have a lot of the Clinton cabal doing the perp walk tomorrow. NYPD has the kiddie fiddling case and that hasn't magically gone away just because of what Jim Comey has said. I can imagine NYPD telling the DOJ to GTFO too, especially if Lynch is involved and gets her collar felt. The Dems could breathe a collective sigh of relief on the e-mails scandal yet have the doors kicked in and be arrested for the Weiner case.
The timing of this announcement is, for the overwhelming majority of voters, more than a little suspicious. At this rate, they would have reviewed over 3,000 emails PER HOUR during the last 8 days.  Anyone thinks that really happened?
Vote brigade coming! Over 50,000 votes!  COVER YOURSELF, 'PEDES

>"all 650.000 emails were dupes of the previously had 33.000 emails."   Bitch, please. EVEN if that was 100% true the shit that is in those 33,000 emails is enough to lock Clinton family for life and some other related people for decades. Insider trading alone is a huge thing that is punished for up to 20 years in prison.
/pol/ are using this to support their view. Does this change anything?  https://twitter.com/Tom_Winter/status/795369503995678720
That is about a thousand times faster. Everyone knows there is only one entity that can reach such speeds, and that is the TRUMP TRAIN, NO BRAKES, THE MAGA MESSAGE WILL WIN.
I mean, I'm sure a lot of them were duplicates. But all 650k? That's absurd. You have to wonder if the FBI was using this email investigation to get an investigation into the Clinton Foundation started. 
Don't trust the media's interpretation... Today Comey said "Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July"  Now go read what he said in July...  https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system  The "private emails" are all smokescreen for the bigger case they are building in secret.   I never looked at their press release timeline before today. Might be sending some hints.... https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel  Either they have been really really busy busting up corruption... or just making it look like that since it is supposed to be their job.   
Our only shot now is to get Trump elected.  #GET THE FUCK OUT AND VOTE!
Bums! Not one of them has the backbone, balls, or integrity to chuck that system and step forward and tell the world the real TRUTH.  
The crooked government would never have indicted. All that ever mattered here is VOTING. Get out and VOTE.
Is this another instance of them just reading the subject line and nothing on the emails themselves? 
There are clearly two sets of rules for certain people in this country.
Comey is so fucked after the election, as many other!
Remember, this new investigation was being supervised by Podesta's friend.   That's why this is fishy.
Well, NYPD, it's up to you guys now.  I'm not holding my breath, because I know how liberal NYC is, but you guys know for sure what is up with the Clintons.  Maybe it's finally time it got shared with everyone like it was going to be?

[Relevant](http://imgur.com/CPLdGzT)
Comey was concerned about his potential new job as permanent tankless scuba-diver
It can also take 8 days for a check to clear... 
So what are we gonna do November 9th after Hillary steals the election...
Redacted is going 100% shill, even harder than normal. They see a possibility to spin this into "Hillary is innocent". I hope no actual human is buying that. It scares me to think that some of them are not paid.
RELEASE THE 33K!!!!!! NOW'S THE TIME!
She will get away with murder this is ridiculous ! Im so ashamed of this country if she becomes president😳
Top of /r/all after 1 hour with 7k upvotes at 5~~9~~7%...  Our energy is simply unstoppable. 
Comey is a traitor to this nation. 
Fuck Comey he had no plans on doing anything. He is on Hillary's payroll and must be forced to resign. 
I truly believe his hurts Hillary more than helps.  
There are 691,200 seconds in 8 days. DIR Comey has thoroughly reviewed 650,000 emails in 8 days at a rate of one per second. Seems legit.
LOCK HER UP!!!!
I came on here after seeing the post from the Clinton sub at 5000 upvotes at the top, with the FBI tweet.  I come here and I see this post and it's not on my front page at all?   I don't even like Donald or Hillary, but wtf is this shit?  Fucking admins. SPEEEEEZZZ!
#DRAIN THE SWAMP
Wikileaks have been promising to come out with something strong against her campaign..lets see if they deliver..tomorrow is the final day
Remember Pedes, this is not the FBI's doing. This is the result of a corrupt DOJ, and the people at the top of the FBI who were handed their jobs instead of earning them.
She fucking gets away with EVERYTHING! Every time! She's worse than a sith lord. Is there no justice in our country anymore?
We live in a Banana Republic governed by Satanic pedophiles and the head of the FBI is a weasel!  Fuck you CERN for screwing with the fabric of reality and merging us into this bizzaro "Berenstain Universe" where all conspiracy theories come true.
8 days = 192 hours   650,000 emails = 3385.4 emails an hour or  56.4 emails a minute.   Yeah. I believe that happened...
Lots gets done when your hands aren't chained by upper management. 
[deleted]
being completely honest here we can't say that all 650k related to the private e-mail server investigation, but it's still a ridiculously short amount of time.  it doesn't change the facts though: clinton is not held to the same laws as regular people. the 'intent' has been exposed by wikileaks and is almost certainly evident on the laptops of the aides. 'intent' is still not needed to prosecute and has been proven by wikileaks and the laws violated have been cited. the corruption is still visible. the partisan DOJ has been confirmed by leaks.  we can only hope enough voters realize this.
they are pulling out all the stops. They know if we vote, we win.  VOTE VOTE VOTE  MAGA 
As a New Yorker I must say, Gotti had nothing on teflon hil.  She's a real gangster.
All the stuff about NYPD and agents going to come forward with the evidence if nothing happens....  Well nothing happened and nothing happened.   /shocked  I truly do hate our government.
As if people were basing there vote off of the FBI decision? I honestly doubt it. Some but not many. Nothing has really changed about her as a candidate. The emails were just one of many. It's like plucking one feather off a chicken and thinking it is a brand new bird. Give me a break.

Roger that
I am happy to upvote a perfectly reasonable photo of the properly and duly elected, sitting, President of these, *OUR* United States of America. To punish someone for upvoting and outwardly showing support of the most powerful person in the free world is absolutely disgusting.
The media said Trump wouldn't be presidential, but this is an extremely presidential portrait.
UPVOTES TILL I GET BANNED
I think it’s funny that they try to suspend people permanently when you can use proxies and/or just keep creating an infinite number of accounts, even using the same exact email address every single time. That’s literally what I do right now. I wasn’t a troll before I got suspended, but now that they suspended me, I’ve made it my life’s mission to harass the shit out of liberals on Reddit. They created the problem that they were trying to stop.
I went up and upvoted every post.

A small price to pay.
I haven't gotten my warning badge of honor yet so here goes:  * Bill Clinton sold nuclear secrets and is a traitor, as well as a rapist and pedophile  * Hillary Clinton is a murderer, swamp creature, and would be drawn and quartered if there was justice.  * Islamic ideology is fundamentally incapable with western society.  * Illegal immigration is anti-working class and anyone who thinks it's a good idea has been tricked by corporate interests trying to suppress wages.  * Western culture is objectively superior to all other cultures.  * Diversity is not a strength.  * College degrees are a scam and their prices skyrocketed because government intervention spearheaded by Joe Biden himself. More government is not the solution to government meddling in the free market.  * Ciaramella is a CIA operative who is involved in an attempted coup, not a whistleblower  * The media is pressured by entrenched oligarchical power to suppress truth by calling it conspiracy theories to try to delegitimize inquiries into their shit for example:  * Epstein didn't kill himself, he was assassinated to cover for powerful pedophiles.  * His name is Seth Rich, the leaks were by an internal objector to bernie's snub. It wasn't Russia.  * Pizzagate is plausible  * Illegal Immigrants vote  * Voter fraud is widespread  * Voter ID is not racist, black people aren't too stupid to get an ID. This is just a social marxist deflection to guard against something that would eliminate large swaths of voter fraud.  * The welfare state does more harm to minorities than every racist in the country combined.  * The problems in the black community are not because of racism, it's because the destruction of the family, the glorification of a violent and unproductive culture, and government welfare disincentivising normal productivity and breeding resentment.  * Body dysphoria is a mental illness and should be treated not indulged.  * Trans athletes shouldn't be able to compete in the division of the gender they're pretending to be.  * Homosexuality is sexual deviancy and should be tolerated due to our country being a free nation where people can do as they please so long as they do not harm the rights of others, but should not be celebrated.  * The wage gap is demonstrably untrue and the reason feminists don't address this is because it involves acknowledging their movement has turned into a farce and that men work longer hours in more dangerous jobs.  * Women and Men are different.  * These differences result in different life choices, personalities, and outcomes that can't be ignored on a macro scale.  * Reddit is a publisher and censors political views and is a complete embarrassment to what it really was and Aaron Swartz is rolling in his grave because of this desecration of his values.  * Aaron Swartz didn't kill himself  * Africa is not a shithole because of colonization or exploitation. China was ruthlessly colonized and exploited *after* Africa and is now the worlds largest growing economy. India was also colonized and is also a massive world economy. South Korea was essentially leveled by a brutal war after being ruthlessly colonized by imperial japan in living memory and is now one of the largest economies on the planet. Japan was literally fucking nuked and it's one the most densely productive and modernized nations the world has ever seen. Africa is not a shithole because it was colonized in the age of sail. The only worthwhile nation in Sub-saharan Africa is South Africa which was established and build by dutch settlers on unsettled land sparsely populated by nomadic bushmen. the Zulu are invaders and since the end of Rhodesia and South Africa proper these countries have *rapidly* descended into shitholes again. It's almost like there is a common theme.  * South African farm murders are a racial genocide.  * The only reason people remember the holocaust more than the other countless genocidal mass slaughterings in the blood soaked 20th century is because (((They))) were the primary victims rather than Armenians, Cambodians, Tutsis, Kulaks, Chinese etc etc.  * Socialism doesn't work and destroys nations.  * Communism is literally worse than Fascism, it has a body count that is so large that human brains can't even comprehend the scale.  * Marxism didn't really make sense during the time period it was created in, and now it's literally just nonsensical LARPing.  * Every "ism" in modern society is essentially made up because simps with no purpose in life desperately need a cause to fight for but are too soft and weak to handle real problems.  * Capitalism is the greatest force for lifting people out of poverty and build the civilized world.  * /u/spez is a cuck  **edit: Bonus round**  * Birthright citizenship is a purposeful misinterpretation of the 14th amendment and should be brought back up before SCOTUS  * Dual citizenship implies split national loyalty and in order to remain an American citizen you should have to renounce all other citizenships. Anyone elected to any public office no matter how small should be ineligible if they claim citizenship of another nation.  * The second amendment is explicit and allows all armaments of any type that would be employed by a military. Restricting any American from possessing any weapon that could theoretically be used by a people's militia in aid of overthrowing the government is an infringement of your inalienable rights. Any court or body that infringes on this right is legislating from the bench, if the American people are uncomfortable with this then they should elect congressmen to amend the bill of rights to be more restrictive. As it stands they are violating the constitution, if they want to stop you from owning a mortar then change the Bill first.  * The amount of people killed in mass shootings is such a tiny fraction of those killed in urban gang violence it's hard to even fathom it.  * The vast majority of gun crime is committed with handguns in cities.   * 297 people were killed with any form of rifle in the united states last year, which includes suicides. This means you are 40x more likely to die from falling down the steps than from being shot with a rifle. Pretending there is an epidemic of assault rifles killing children is propaganda by gun grabbers.  * Aborting a child that is viable on it's own is no longer your body your choice, it's murder.  * Nothing can be a human right that requires the labor of others.  * If climate change activists actually believed what they were saying they'd be advocating for massive sanctions against China and India to curb the world's largest sources of pollution. If we cut out fossil fuel consumption to literally 0% overnight magically China would still be belching out massive amounts of greenhouse gas.
Upvoting this image will clutter the front page the morning after the Democratic debate.  The admins want to sway the election.  They have been planning this for a while.    They want to distract us.  Instead of memeing about how bad the Democratic debate was, we took their bait.  I woke up looking forward to red pilling memes about the awful debate.  Instead we’re talking about moving a good portion of Republicans on reddit to a website that will have little meaning in a year.  Trump can only win one more election.

Reddit HATES Americans!
Autist Note:  The 50 stars are nicely symmetrically dispalyed as:  4x5 + 5x6 = 20 + 30 = 50
We are all proud fucking Americans
I’ll upvote because I’m a Patriot. But I’ve been upvoting a lot of these and I’m still here.
As a Dutchman, I like that flag!
Fuck it, ban me.
As someone who had the pleasure of living in the USA for 4 years, I can honestly say that I love the American flag just as much as my own.
Ban me, sluts!
Banned!
Upvoted on all my accounts
Wtf. Can we fucking stop with the karma whoring posts on this sub.
This is what they HATE the most
I'm a simple man I see Merican flag, I upvote, ban be damned. Fuck you reddit cucks.
You got mu upvote!!
HA HA HA. UPVOTE!!!!!!!
Then frickin ban me, I love this country!  America first!
I will always upvote the stars are stripes. Regardless of who is in the white house I am patriotic and love this country, it is deeper than one man or one office.
Am I the only one that noticed the extremely high upvote numbers on TD since that wrongrhink policy?
Fuck.
Wonderful flag 👍🏼
I wasnt able to upvote or comment all day yesterday and now it works... weird.  It warms my heart to see this sub and its users. 8k in 4 hours ain't bad.
Love it!
So what, I'm still a rock star!
HARDER DADDY

I find it hilarious how this backfired on Reddit so hard. Everyone who was 50/50 on trump or even the Republican Party is really waking up now that they see how fascist Reddit (a liberal company) is.
17.7k upvotes??  Hmm how come all the sudden we can get 17k upvotes but any other time it’s 2-3k capped.  Fuck that fuck you
When will I get my ban hammer of honor?!
And our flag was still there..:)
I keep upvoting and still haven't got slapped down. What gives?
Updoot for God and Country then ;)
THE AMERICAN FLAG IS RAYCISS
Reddit mods can derlict my balls
Meh.
I think those lib-arts journalism degree commies should LEARN TO CODE .... amirght ?
For God and Country.
Going out in blaze of glory
13 stripes and 50 stars HMMMMMMM
Apparently they’re locking a lot of posts now, too.
Wish I could upvote 1776 times
That's a spicy meme right there
extra points if you upvote the rainbow flag though. right, reddit?
Can someone tell me why all of a sudden, these posts are starting to hit over the 10k mark? Shit was all fishy with all this stupid admin and upvote shit going on, but this is making my senses tingle even more.
Why are all the threads being locked?
21 thousand upvotes and still not in r/all? crazy world reddit
I fail to understand how upvoting an image of the American Flag would get anyone banned? From where exactly, reddit? I seriously doubt that, hyperbole maybe?  There must be some recent drama I missed apparently because I don't get it.

You can’t seriously be convinced that supporting pedophiles is a part of liberalism.. as for transgenders, have you no empathy for someone who experiences gender dysphoria? I can’t even imagine the mental anguish and who am I to say they shouldn’t have the freedom to do whatever they want with their own bodies, what more right to property do any of us have?  “Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country” it’s about we’re all in this together vs winners take all and losers be damned. Challenging and resisting our tribal nature and sincerely considering alternate perspectives
__There is one simple reason why Democrats constantly disrespect the national anthem and burn the flag.__  #Democrats hate America.
Surprised this isn’t locked yet also
I wish I could upvote this 1000 times.
This is some "Facebook deleted this the first time" type of idiot bait
*How Dare You !!!*
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America
That’s a risk I’m willing to take
I dare those fucking admin faggots
Our country isn’t perfect, but not a day goes by that I’m not grateful for my freedoms. No other place like it and I’m proud to be an American. God bless America.
I recently joined reddit, why is this quarantined? and what does that even mean? I joined this sub just because it got quarantined
In a few weeks this might as well be marked NSFW
Ban away !!
From my cold Banned hands! 🇺🇸
No one cares. Will upvote on all my alts
Damn, by guys
GOD BLESS AMERICA, YOU PINKO COMMIE FUCKS!!!! A.Bunker 1974
No it won't.
Done! F*** em. USA! USA! USA!
It'll be my last upvote then
Yikes. This sub’s become nothing but karma whoring. Regardless, MAGA 2020, 2024 and 2028

SHILLS HAVE TAKEN OVER  TD IS DEAD
SNL writer calls Barron Trump a 'homeschool shooter' be a shame if a bunch of us forwarded this to NBC
Picking on a 10 year old boy? 
Must have had some backlash...looks like she deleted it. 
[deleted]
**Don't forward the message to NBC.  Someone might be in trouble.**  #That'd suck.
That is so low and despicable.
They're not the only ones picking on a child  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2pJgcXXUAASUwM.jpg
yet twitter will delete shkreli's account for less than this  fucking hypocrites
The Onion made a homeschool shooter joke 10+ years ago and she probably stole it from that.
She should be fired immediately. And as a true coward, she is now protecting her Tweets. She attacks a 10 year old but can't handle attacks on herself
Please feel free to write NBC - http://www.nbc.com/contact-us
But they're anti bullying right ?. Cretins.
the Internet never forgets  Barron is master of the Internet  Barron Never Forgets
Nasty alleged woman.

We're reaching salt levels that shouldn't even be possible 
It would be real shame if we were to post that on every tweet she makes for the next 4 years as a reminder of her mistake so that she never does it again :-) Or at least we should keep tweeting it to her until she makes a formal apology. 
Don't we try to encourage anti-bullying sentiments in schools and towards younger kids? Like why talk shit about a 10 year old, too? This guy's a grown man?
I didn't vote for Trump but damn. Barron is a 10 year old kid. Leave him out of your "politics."  If you're picking on a 10 year old for looking bored at an inauguration or sleepy at an acceptance speech, you're a piece of shit.

Don't go to NBC, go to their advertisers.  Get a list of whoever advertises during SNL, write them a strongly worded letter that they don't want to be associated with someone who attacks a child due to his lineage.  Make strong mentions that you'll fail to buy their product (and follow through, always forward, never back, no pussy!)
Fuck these people. This is different from attacking Trump. Absolute human garbage. Perfect for SNL
[deleted]
Good thing SNL isn't even relevant anymore 
No one said anything about Obama's kids for 8 years and on the first day they resort to this. Lowest of the low.
Hey lurking leftists:  When your side is openly attacking ten year old kids, and literally *none* of you disavow them, you show *the world* exactly what you are. Why in the *fuck* would any person with even an inkling of moral values vote for anyone *you* endorse?
Gutless is now "protected tweets"  What a moron.
Liberal Hollywood is disgusting, attcking kids, having spirit cooking parties and belittling the common man... and getting the Medal of Honor for it!! Glad to have a real guy in the White House!!!
Here's the link to the archived Tweet  http://archive.is/ouKzE  Here's the link to NBC's online complaint form  http://www.nbc.com/contact-us  Let 'em have it, boys!  
Am on the left.... this is horrible
Wish I knew how to email Loren Michaels.  I would give him an earful.  He knows the game and that is not acceptable. 
These people are so fucking stupid. Do you know what kind of thermonuclear meltdown they would have if a writer said this about one of Obama's children?  They are complete hypocrites. 
Didn't vote for Trump. I don't like him. But keep his kid out of your tweets. Be a fucking human being.
For an SNL writer, I'm surprised by the lack of humor in her joke (I'm really not).
As someone who used to identify as left/liberal, I dunno what the fuck these people are thinking anymore.  I gradually distanced myself because it was more and more like a cult.  Now I'm happy as an independent/libertarian and i don't fucking want any god-damned thing to do with these brutal psychos.
Oh look, another leftist obsessed with children. Seems to be a theme.
8 years the Obama kids were off-limits, and rightfully so. 7 minutes into Trump's term and the Leftists are attacking his child. Disgusting. 
First post here, long time follower.   First off, fuck MSM, jesus... Who the fuck would say that about a kid?  Secondly, that kid is adorable and I'm sure he is a great kid.   Edit: never watching SNL again. Eff them
All of this shit is stupid.  My views are fairly liberal.  I honestly worry about Trump and some of his policies.  But the protesting I've seen today disgusts me.  It makes no difference and is just destruction for the sake of destruction.  I live in America and damn it Trump is now my President so I hope he does well for US. 
Barron is only 10 and more accomplished than this puke of a human could ever be.
[deleted]
These people are pure filth. I am ashamed to admit that I used to vote Democrats.
These fucking people have no moral compass, no higher virtue, no honor to be seen whatsoever. They will attack anyone. They lie  implicitly to further any goal. They will ignore and distort reality to fool you. They will flood a discussion with emotion, that logic and reason have no room to be present. **They believe the ends justify the means; and will ignore unapparent consequences so long as they think their goal superficially  sounds good. **  Most of these modern leftists and "liberals" have no idea they have been brainwashed and manipulated by the people who have carefully conceived all of these little "movements" and fad talking points. The ones at the head of this plan care even less for those they manipulate then we, the ones they see as their enemy. They are using them in a political power game like pawns to be programmed and pointed in a direction, then thrown away with the rest of us.  **Only, it is these leftists and protesters who should be joining us in the fight against the elitists. We are fighting for you and you don't even know it. You fall for divisive tactics, and we still take the high road. Some day they'll come to see they've been fooled and will realize they can fight for those same basic freedoms they claim to want along side us.**  Break your programming. We're all in this together. Stop falling for emotional manipulation. Trump wants what's best for all Americans and can work with anyone, just as we here can. It's time you opened your eyes to the real enemies.
FUCK SNL.  FUCK HOLLYWOOD. 
Melania will tear her at least two new orifices.
That's leftists for you.  At this point, I'm just grateful they're not trying to fuck him. 
 I didn't even vote for the guy but that's fucked up.  Leave the kid alone aholes. 
10 years old you sick fuck. Fire this cunt.

Did she make her twitter private?  If so, **COWARD**!  "this account's tweets are protected"  *OF COURSE THEY ARE*!
What's worse is that she genuinely thinks she's clever.  I'd love to spend 5 minutes on this board with the clever moron. But that's the thing about these people, they're basically cowards outside their cool kids club.  She probably thought this up while going down on Alec Baldwin.

Never thought I would agree with a post on here, but this isn't cool man. He's a kid.  Edit: wtf I got banned on some subreddit for even posting in here lol 
The tolerant left, folks!
Shkareli still banned? I found him a new gf.
Damn. So bad at handling defeat they attack a 10 year old.
Wow.  What the fuck is wrong with that bitch's brain?      She literally cannot separate what she thinks of as a harmless joke from what it really is - attempted child abuse and bullying over the internet.      I'm sure her and her tiny circle of friends thought it was funny.      The rest of America, not so much.      Lorne, you're a practical man, it's time to start cleaning house before they drive your ratings into the ground and get you cancelled for an "In Living Color" reboot.
How disgusting. What a horrible person she is.
I'm going to have Katie Rich for dinner.  All I need is a blender and some hot sauce.  # ALLEGEDLY!!!  # HYPOTHETICALLY!!!!
Why would NBC care? They'd probably congratulate her for being soooo funny. Exactly why SNL has no respect from anyone who isn't an extreme leftist
"Love trumps hate". Ya right, liberal hypocrisy. Attacking a 10 year old can only be fueled by hate. 
That's what I call professional suicide.
Can someone please forward this to not only NBC, but other news outlets, both major and alternative? 
[Contact NBC and send your regards](http://www.nbc.com/contact-us) (212) 664-2333.
She bullies a 10 year old boy the day his father is sworn in to be the president of USA. I have no words. 
"Bullying is always wrong, except when people deserve it. You know, like young children."
Seriously WTF are these people thinking, attacking a 10 year old. Politics has seriously fucked these people up. 
Fuck SNL and fuck NBC.  Boycotting all their shit.  Commentary during the inauguration was just as retarded as the shit Katie Rich says.  It's no wonder SNL isn't funny when these are the people they hire to write.  Remember when they had talent, like back in the 80s and 90s?
Ten fucking years old. The depravity is breathtaking. 
If someone archived it, send it with the screenshot! We need to spread this around!
How classy!    Let's get this bitch fired.
Send it to companies that buy ads from NBC.
Dumb bitch already dwepped her twitter account
Remember when snl was funny? Me either.
Why are they attacking of all people Barron Trump? Last time they tried to say he was autistic because he was tired from staying up until 3AM. So pathetic!
It doesn't even make sense and isn't funny... so definitely sounds like something an SNL writer would write.
Takes a certain type of a-hole to attack a 10 yearold.
Typo, OP.  Should be "former" SNL writer.
So evil
That's an awfully horrible thing to say about another person, about a child no less, and that's a really terrible thing to joke about.
This person is such a fucking piece of shit. Fuck that idiot with a football.
Why are people so mean to this kid?  He's about the most well behaved 10 year old in the country.  Such assholes.
Seriously?  He's  10 years old.  This biotch has problems.  Barron seems like a he's a good kid.  SNL has not been funny in over a decade.
53% upvoted, the "tolerant" left
I remember the wailing and gnashing of teeth at the very thought of anyone on the Right saying an untoward thing about Sasha and Malia, and no one ever did, through Obama's entire Presidency.  It took them less than ten minutes into Trump's Presidency to attack Barron. Must be because he's a boy... #snlmisandry
This is the height of being oblivious to reality. You don't insult a ten year old child, it's just wrong. I don't care if you don't like his father, his mother, his fucking housekeeper or whoever but you don't pick on an innocent child. 
I will never watch NBC again.
Up vote this if you reported this poor excuse of a human. Let's keep track.
Remember when that [Congressional staffer made fun of the Obama daughters?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/12/01/embattled-hill-staffer-elizabeth-lauten-reportedly-resigns-after-controversial-remarks/?utm_term=.728c6e113fa6). Yeah, she resigned. 
she's regretting this already. ouch! 
This is who's writing for SNL?   Guess we know why they'll never be RATINGS MACHINEs like the Donald!
Another reason not to watch SNL
It doesn't even make sense...
Tweeted to NBC and NBCSNL and shocker her account is private 
Well, she lost.  It has been deleted.  I guess the tolerant leftists don't like being called out for their forays into bullying.
I don't support Trump nor did I vote for him. But I sure as hell support those who voted for him.
Saw the first line and would just like to leave a quick post.  Many users here generally have differing opinions when it comes to politics. Hell, even us mods have disagreed over stuff before. The reasons why rules 2 and 6 exist are mostly due to people either spamming, attempting to slide threads and the fact that R/The_Donald was intended to function like a 24/7 Trump rally (essentially we're not the place for heavy discussion).   People can get heated when they're discussing political opinions and to keep the energy high here, we have a designated domreddit for discussion to help avoid problems here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskThe_Donald/  *Edit  I did forget about: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrumpsupporters
A man who values speech and a platform for them as well. That's downright American.   Edit: Man, woman, attack helicopter, gender binary fluid etc. 
Notice how OP doesn't "get banned for not agreeing with us". Thanks for having some sense.   Edit(Hopefully not spez): I was just complementing OP's ability to see the truth that what spez is doing is disgraceful. To anyone whos been banned from T-D, I am not a mod and have no control over that.
Thanks man. We need people like you if we wanna make America Great again
That's nice to hear man. Started feeling like the majority of the left supported idiots like u/spez, along with all 'liberal' media censorship and propaganda, shunning all alternative ways of thinking and ideas.
One thing that reasonable people have in common regardless of ideology is an understanding that free speech is the foundation of this country, many good people have died protecting our freedoms.  It's really distressing to see so many trying to prohibit speech, shut down opposing viewpoints and trample on our liberties.  I appreciate you posting here and reinforcing the need to listen to each other, accept that we're not all alike, but have much in common relative to upholding the right for people to speak freely.
>Suppression of dissent is about as fascist as it gets.   This guy gets it. I wouldn't even say we are dissenting, we are just opposing. Its similar but not exactly the same. 
Older man here, this post is how liberals used to be. Back when they didn't snowflake out and suck balls.  
I agree with you on many points; I paid close attention to many Trump rallies where he would repeat how the campaign is not about him, but about the American people.  So, taking that into account, I'm interested in Mr Trump when he actually takes office so I can judge him on his actions, not pure speculation. His supporters? Well, we just want a better planet with coherent politicians in every government.  If this can be achieved, then you know... Maybe women will be allowed to drive cars in Saudi Arabia and the Yazidi and Kurds will be able to sleep without fear of death and rape.  America is a huge global superpower, if corruption and such can be dealt with, it will be much, much easier for the rest of the world to begin moving forwards.  For me personally, it's absolutely nothing to do with Trump, it's about how Trump can encourage the people to do and achieve a better quality of life for everyone involved.
Get this man a coat!!!
Thanks for standing in solidarity with us. Completely agree with your pov.
Thank you for saying this. On the same note, I think it's important to hear arguments from the left, debate is one of the best ways to progress ideas. Unfortunately it's been difficult for us to express our views with a rational, intelligent, response from whoever we're arguing against. You're very right when you say it's wrong to censor a forum where discussion is so actively encouraged. 
Yeah, I've commented on here a few times and mentioned that I think Trump is shit. I'm just honest. I think Hillary is shit too though. I have to admit it grates on me that there's so much Trump spam (to some degree) but I hate it far more that they're censored. That's not what I'm about.      Edit: It has occurred to me that while I'm being up* voted more than not (as usual here) there are children among who down voted the guy below who agrees with me. Remember, I'm just an opposing opinion who supports your right to your opinion. That we both voice our opinions makes us both better. I have always appreciated that people upvote me despite my strong opinions against the president-elect. I'm just trying to make the minority of you that downvote think a little.      Edit 2: Up not down. Whoopsy.
We appreciate that, patriot!
[deleted]
Reddit censorship started when they removed upvote/downvote weight. That actually meant you could argue without being demoralized, you'd see you had 100 upvotes/80 downvotes the guy you argued had 40 but he had 60 upvotes and 20 downvotes and you saw your opinion was as supported as discorded.   Vote weight needs to come back specially to /r/politics and sub that thrives off of discussion the current system just creates hivemind
This is what I don't get. T_D gets accused of creating an echo chamber as well, but somehow I've mentioned that I didn't vote Trump and I disagree with a few of his stances and you know what? I'm still here. Did I get downvoted a little? Sure, but I'm still a member.  Hell, I made a comment yesterday on the Spez thread and was downvoted to hell (literally my most controversial post ever) and all I said was this (it was in reference to a user wanting to be able to block all posts showing up from anyone subbed to T_D):  "So you don't want to hear anything anyone from this particular group has to say. If only there was a term for that.  Here's the thing. Creating these echo chambers is part of what caused many democrats (and third party voters) to be blindsided by the election results. Flat out not listening to anyone that doesn't agree with you politically isn't going to solve anything. I say this as someone who is subbed to The_Donald and didn't vote for him (I voted Stein). The subreddit actually covered many things during the election other political subs and media sources wouldn't touch (i.e. WikiLeaks- which is why I subbed in the first place). Yeah, I see issues with the subreddit but simply ignoring them isn't going to solve anything. It's part of the problem that is making the rift between people in this country so prevalent right now. Everyone wants to believe what they are being fed (both sides of the political spectrum are guilty of this) and just runs with as little info as possible.  If you think no Trump supporter has anything of value to say you need to step outside your vacuum. I freaking hate Clinton, but you know what? One of the people I talk to most about politics is a die hard Clinton supporter. You can hate Trump all day long, but hating ALL of his supporters makes you guilty of the same shit you probably assume of his supporters.   There are idiots on both sides of the fence- don't join the ranks, and don't assume the idiots are exclusive to the other side."  More than one person has replied to that saying essentially no one subbed here has anything of value to add to any conversation. I've been trying to reach out to some of these people, and I realize some are a lost cause but Jesus so many people think they can just write off anyone who has an opposing view point.  I've tried being nice and civil. I've even pointed out that I voted for Stein and I'm told that was as good as voting for Trump (even though I'm a fucking republican). Some of these people just don't want to be reached. Some of them just want to sit in their respective vacuums of information and refuse to even consider view points that oppose theirs. I'll continue to try and have level head discussions about politics around reddit, but it seems this sub is the place that I don't instantly get the "fuck all of this group" responses. Interesting that they call this sub an echo chamber but I get more bigoted responses when I try to talk to people outside this sub.
Another liberal hear.... Shit like this(trying to hide you guys) is exactly why we lost the election(well our candidate was shit too). The amount of hypocrisy that the left commits and is blind to is actually kind of scary.  I don't agree with you guys a lot, but trying to ban you is easily the dumbest thing I've ever seen on reddit....which is saying a lot!
I hereby nominate you as an honorary centipede. All in favor say 'kek'. 
As a man who is as middle ground as it gets intellectually. I am with you my friend. I am liberally minded socially and Conservatively minded fiscally.  However, I believe in approaching social reforms through a fiscally conservative mindset. This is why I supported Donald Trump. He is a  New York Social liberal and a old school Reagan style fiscal conservative.  What the left doesn't understand about us and our movement is that the moment Trump fails us, we will be in the streets in greater force than anything you have seen.  We are sick of the entirety of the system. Not just one side. It all needs to go!  DRAIN THE SWAMP!
I may not agree with what you're saying, but I'll fight to the death for your right to say it.
I'm not even American but I'm glad I can finally filter out enoughtrumpspam and all those shitty subs that just bash this one.  So thanks guys.  You guys I can tolerate.    Where do I get this fucking coat from? 
Absolutely agree. I can't believe the amount of people that are ecstatic to censor people they disagree with. I always try to expose myself to as many viewpoints as I can.  Scary times we live in.
I don't agree with Trump on everything and I didn't vote for him either but my heart goes out to you, Centipedes. Keep fighting the good fight (and posting them dank may mays). Vive La Donald.
So glad I saw this. Thank you. Most of the comments I've seen from the other side said that this was "deserved" because they are annoyed with so many Trump posts...they only want to see cats and porn on reddit.. etc. Well doesn't the filtering on r/all fix that for you? Why support censorship?  There are many things from the left I don't agree with. But I would NEVER support censorship of those viewpoints. This bullshit from spez is just the first step.
I was about to post something similar.  I'm not a Trump supporter but think, having won, he ought to be given a fair chance.  Also don't the idiots manipulating reddit realise that their undemocratic antics will probably make people LESS likely to support them and their preferred candidate?
I have massive amounts of respect for liberals and conservatives that are willing to accept the other side.
Thank you for your support!  Free speech definitely involves freedom to speak.  
Most liberals are like you, but I'm afraid of the few who aren't.  That's why I'm still in the closet.
Frankly, it would do the democratic party well to listen to the people who rejected them. 
Right on.  All about freedom!
Many of us visit the_donald for this specific reason. If our opinions are not constantly challenged, how would we know we have the best opinions?
Scrolled through the thread and found some concern trolling and lots of shill down votes.  Get over it guys,  Hildebeast lost and rational thought won. If you actually cared about your bullshit you would study all points of view and vote in more than just Presidential elections. 
Hey a person with some integrity :) and sense. 
Support Trump to Make America Great Again #maga
Honestly I disagree with most of Trumps views. But I agree with this posters sentiment.  You aren't going to get rid of bigotry by persecuting people for their beliefs.
#Principled opposition is a good thing.... REEEEEEE you're racist so we are shutting you down isnt
> we (the left) NEED to hear you  And Trump wants to hear you! https://apply.ptt.gov/yourstory/
You're different from most liberals because you voted against him, was upset when he won, but realized that's how our country works and moved on
This. Your a decent human beeing BooleanAlgebra.
And I appreciate people like you, even if you don't support my candidate of choice.  We need many different views to keep us all honest and in check.
[deleted]
Thank you for writing this. You're absolutely right. I'm mostly conservative (sans some social issues), but I have a massive distrust of Trump. However, I distrust more those people who don't listen to opposing viewpoints, and scream down or ignore people they disagree with. On either side of the aisle. I worry Trump has and will ruin politics for a while, but I'll always listen and discuss politics with his supporters with respect. 
##THANK YOU, BASED FELLOW REDDIT DENIZEN!!

Hey man, thanks for the support!  We're not terrible people, I swear!  We may disagree on policy, but at the end of the day we're all AMERICANS!  
Poor OP..  now that he's posted here he'll be banned from posting in a bunch of liberal biased subs.
>but god damnit we (the left)   You aren't "the left".  Democracy is poison for your "left".  Free spech is poison for your "left".  Absence of racial division is poison for your "left".  Your supposed "left" are as corporate, etablishment, ultra-monopolist-big-corp-locust as it gets. Actually once upon a time, your "left" posed to represent the working class average people. Of course they always ended up as the elitists champagne sipping smug faced globalist vultures that they are today.
 Hey /u/BooleanAlgebra,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
If you ever get too cold out there, we'll have a coat waiting!
Well, it's especially disheartening because republicans control every facet of the federal government and far more states than the left does.  It's very unintelligent to not hear us out.  Looking at u/spez.
I would love to have a real political discussion with someone, but all I hear or read on politics is how the Republicans are mean, nasty rapists of the world. Any disagreement is met with downvotes. I never supported Trump either, but being brigaded just recently for a comment on politics has pushed me over here.   EDIT: After finding the spez button (good one, btw), I removed the link to the "other political sub"

I couldn't vote because I'm an Australian shitposter. I ardently support #equalrightsonreddit.

Please try and share your common sense with others on the Left. My friends refuse to listen to me. They're deadest on the conditioned response. 
"I don't agree what you say but I'll defend to death your right to say it" - Voltaire
We just want to be treated equally and have our voices heard. It's unbelievable to me that so many people who claim to agree with this standpoint say that we should not be treated equally and should be silenced. If the people who claimed to have values of equality and free speech truly believed in those things, they would WANT to hear us. We listen to everyone and accept everyone with open arms.
And the number of subscribers skyrockets to over 313,000.  Censoring us just makes us stronger.    They do not get it at all.
**THIS IS AT THE TOP OF R/ALL**  **AHAHAHAHA**  [Proof](https://i.sli.mg/WAE0bv.png)
Thanks fellow American!  🇺🇸
Yeah, it's more than noticeable how the left says they wanna "open up a dialogue" right after they silence opposition.  Glad to see someone gets it.
your first mistake was thinking reddit is about free speech 
Hopefully this is a start to something better, i'm with ya.
I think it's pretty obvious spaz needs to get fired.  What's really sad is he'll pretend he's super famous and successful to whoever he tries to get a new job with, and I wouldn't expect Taco Bell to double check his purported history too thoroughly.  At least he can be famous there.
I...I can't honestly believe I'm posting on T_D but I have to agree with OP. (Fair Warning, this may get long I have a lot to get off my chest)  I'm about as moderate as you get for a 20 something. Both Hillary and Donald were about as far from what I wanted in a president (Bernie too while you are at it). But this whole thing has become crazy.  I understand where a good chunk of reddit is coming from saying they loathe T_D. Some days the memeing is too much for me but I  just keep scrolling. I get that there is a sub-section of this community that is pure cancer. Now how wide and deep reaching it is I don't know. I hope the mods are on top of racists, bigots, etc. etc. but with some 50 mods I'm sure there is dissenting opinions.  I understand T_D and a large portion of America when they voted for Trump. I couldn't support him for a great many reasons but I get it. People are fed up with the Status Quo. I get that hard working Americans feel like everything they work for is for nought. Hell I kinda even get the feeling that America is pandering to much to vocal minorities on issues (even though I don't agree with).   So here's the thing, *T_D NEEDS to exist* Without a chance to be open, vocal, and heard then our compounding problem of dissidence will just grow even larger. And that is where I have a HUGE problem with what /u/spez did. It opened a massive can of worms and on top of that the whole change about sticky posts only affecting T_D is silly.  I know T_D can't fundamentally change it's identity the memes and word usage (cuck, libtard, centipede) are all part of you'alls identiy as a sub. But imo that is what gets to a lot of people with opinions different from your own. It's like your mom told you in grade school. "If you have nothing to say don't say it at all"  So (and I don't know how to write this well), I ask you T_D don't let your vocal minority be the defining thing in your sub. A good chunk of you believe in MAGA and that's great I wish everyone was so passionate about making their country the best it can be. Part of what makes America great is that we are a great many people from all different backgrounds and cultures but we are still ONE.   Two final things:  1. Please just remember there are a great many on reddit and in the world that doesn't agree with you, that doesn't make them or you wrong. Support them through understanding their point of view and working to shared goals.   2. Keep fighting for your rights. Censoring and silence are the tools of oppression and the weak. A filtered/censored reddit is only a couple of stages removed from controlled news.   I may not have voted for T_D but I do respect the office and will try to keep an open mind in the coming months and years. I truly do hope this MAGA happens what that means or what it will become though is up to us as Americans in general.  I'm out.
Does spez give himself gold, or are people just that ignorant? 
This is why /r/EnoughTrumpSpam's reaction to the whole issue annoys me to no end. Instead of standing for free speech, an issue which should be omni-partisan, they relish in any form of suppression of people they don't agree with. 
Thank you. I appreciate the mutual respect. One thing: we don't live in a democracy. We live in a constitutional republic represented by democratically elected officials 
You know what that's called? Being a god damn American. Have an uptrump and know that a coat will always be ready for you, should you choose to take it.   FUCK /u/spez #equalrightsonreddit 
>Suppression of dissent is about as facist as it gets. I may not agree with you, I may not even like you but god damnit we (the left) NEED to hear you! Discourse ESPECIALLY with differing views is the only way democracy works, without it this country will never address the problems that face all of us. I voted against Trump and was dissapointed when he won but fucking CHRIST I am outraged when a platform designed to foster discussion and free speech works to censor people it doesn't agree with.    FUCK /u/spez  #equalrightsonreddit    
If only Obama saw fit to put some of this in one of his speeches.
Thank you - respectful disagreement is welcome. You may not prefer Trump's brand of politics, and I respect that.  The common thread that brings us together is the ability to have a respectful, honest, and uncensored discussion.   Reddit is on the wrong side of a slippery slope, I'm afraid.
It's like how I feel with flagburners. I find it disgusting, hate them, and want to punch them, but... that freedom to be despicable is technically what we cherish most and hold dear.
Can we get this user an honorary coat?
I agree with OP. I didn't vote for Trump, and I am quite skeptical of his Presidency. I will continue to challenge his decisions and urge people to consider whether or not he is representing us or not.  But he is our President.  He is my President.  I will support him in as far as the office demands; and I believe that Openly and honest disagreement is the greatest respect for a position that is inhabited by a free person elected voluntarily by free people.  I think you guys go off the rails sometime...but I would never ever dream of suggesting you be censored, or Reddit treating you differently than other subs. Hey /u/spez; what about SRS, and their brigade army? Are there plans to clean that sub up too? Note, it's so bad that I even fear linking to it in this post because they will harass me.
As a libertarian, I voted GJ but was in the neverhillary camp as well.  Was excited to see Trump win and spent most of my time during the campaign (and post election) in this sub.  Centipedes are a damn fine group of folks.
I swear to God. I miss one day on here and **everything changes**. Good Lord. 
Sorry guys one of my favorite subreddits r/fatpeoplehate was removed. I used it for motivation everyday before working out. It wasn't allowed to be filtered it was removed. You guys are all over the front of r/all everyday which is a lot more aggressive than fph was. I refuse to filter your sub though because that shit is for weak minded people, I just see your posts and move on. Be happy you still have your sub because free speech isn't allowed on Reddit anymore unless it agrees with their new safe space policy.   "I Disapprove of What You Say, But I Will Defend to the Death Your Right to Say It"                                   -Evelyn Beatrice Hall                                 (The Friends of Voltaire)   Edit btw if you want to go see someone get their brains blown out in hd head of over to r/watchpeopledie yea but take away r/thedonald and r/fatpeoplehate!!! How stupid are people. 
I agree with OP.  If the left and right don't talk WITH each other and not just AT each other, there can be no progress.  We will just continue the Sisyphean task of trying to win power over the other side, just to watch it all go to shit 8 years later.  Our media is doing us no favors, blowing rainbows up our respective asses, offering us therapy and flattery.  A functional America would mean both sides listening to each other, and being humble enough to admit that some things will have to move to the left, and some things will have to move to the right, but it'll be ok, because if we discuss it, it will only be those things which make sense to move that way, and not just a bunch of trophy victories for one side that'll just get trashed in 8 years.  I'm really getting sick of this back and forth.  I lived overseas for a year, and it's not like this in other countries. 
GIVE THIS MAN A COAT
Trumps policy's imo are fucking insane but I do not agree at all with comment editing. Spez has probably done it before and this is when we caught him.   
Rahhhhhhhhhh! 
Voltaire? Is ghost tip?
Seriously, everyone thinks we're using hyperbole when we say it's fascism and 1984, but THIS SHIT ALWAYS SEEMS LITTLE WHEN IT STARTS! Did German Jews justify being made to wear stars? Sure they fucking did.   First they came for the FAT PEOPLE HATE, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a fatty hater.  Then they came for the PIZZA, and I did not speak out— Because I was not A PIZZA.  Then they came for the PEPE, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Frog.  Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me. (there is. It's The_Donald)
The fucking moronic behaviour of the admins and mods on this site have finally turned me from a lurker to a poster. The idiotic left used to be useful idiots, now they're just useless cunts! If they wanted the_donald to go away they had to do ONE thing. Ignore it! That was it! But Noooo! 'I can't bear to expend the energy to move my eyes past the words I don't like to see so I'll try to ban them!' Well, I whole hardheadedly endorse this post and its sentiment, fuck /u/spez you little shit! 
You're the right of reason, sadly /u/spez doesn't see it the same way. I'm sure the people in r/politics are cheering though. 
I don't know how the rules work for you guys but I feel this strange urge to offer you a coat. 
Thank you for putting your neck out to support us in this way.  It's a relief to know that people are still able to read between the lines and think for themselves.
The most disturbing part of this election for me was acceptance of ability for nearly all of media, celebrities, teachers/professors, Hillary  and even most of vocal Americans to openly mock, threaten and even physically beat people who were going to vote or voted for trump.    And it continues after the election with a focus on how this happened, etc.  Very disturbing but also reassuring that people voted their conscience even if they were afraid to admit it.
Not to be that guy but we have a representative constitutional republic... Not a democracy.. 
It's been the same with brexit. The supposedly open minded left have become ironically fascist in the way they express their views and piss on everyone else's views. The SJW's are not helping the cause.
It's funny how reddit is attempting to go the a ame way as college pussy campuses and have a safe space where they don't have to hear or see anything they don't like. Yeah because THATS a healthy way to go through life, in a fucking echo chamber
Holy shit, give this man a medal. I agree. Not giving people access to the platform because of their beliefs is a horrible move. I actually like watching /r/politics and /r/The_Donald duke it out in /r/all.
/u/spez unleashed a dangerous precedence.
Thank you for your support. I'm contacting the tailor to start working on a coat just in case you come around. 
I like how since this guy posted this, it hasn't been removed I haven't seen any hate, racism, misogyny, against OP. Yet their the " **tolerant** " ones by singling us out, and censorship.
I, too, am someone who doesn't support Trump and didn't vote for him, but I am disgusted by the childish reaction of the left. The rioting, the violence, the censorship, and the crying out for Hillary to be given the presidency anyway are all behaviors that are wretched and deplorable.  I have been finding myself constantly defending Trump against insane accusations from both people on the internet and people in real life, and I don't even like the guy! But you know what I like even less than Trump? Bullshit and lies. It's infuriating.  It has become clear to me that reddit is no longer a place for open discussion, that the majority of mods and admins and the CEO have decided to support one political narrative over another. To those of us on the left, this is not how you win! You win with honesty and integrity, not with censorship and propaganda.  The left need to hear from you, r/the_donald. They need to realize that their political opponents aren't just a "basket of deplorables", but a large segment of the American population with legitimate arguments and positions that NEED to be heard. I may not agree with the majority of you, but I would never, ever deny your right to be heard, because that's what being American is all about.  Fuck you, u/spez.  EDIT: Oh, hey, looks like this post was removed from the front page of reddit. Fucking awesome job, reddit, way to suppress viewpoints you disagree with. Fuck. Is this what it's come to? Has the left gotten so nutty that they'll censor other people on the left just for LISTENING to people on the right? Fucking absurd.
Bernie supporter here an Indian and a Muslim. I fucking love this madman they call Trump. Haven't seen balls this hard since scarface. 
Yes! Exactly!
First they came for us. Is your community next? #equalrightsonreddit
What's even more hilarious is that, despite the filtering, we've gained about 1k subs in the last hour.   I've heard people talking about T_D "fading out"... lmao. The more they try to silence this sub the larger it grows.  You lefties really don't know what you're dealing with here. People are fucking fed up with you and yet you continue to do the shit that has caused people to be pissed off in the first place.  Edit* edit button is now "spez". Gold.

I come here from r/all   I'm not a Trump supporter, I'm not a Clinton supporter. I'm european and I don't give a shit about american politics, we have our issues already. But as a reddit user who believes in equals rights of speech I'm extremely annoyed by /u/spez 's manipulations and all the censorship on this site against r/the_donald subreddit. I'm for freedom of speech.  If you care about an "external" POV, I see r/EnoughTrumpSpam way worse than r/The_Donald. Because at least here you get what you expect. That subreddit could be as well be called r/The_Hillary because that's what it is in reality, but they hide as an "against Trump" subreddit. It's full of pro-Hillary post over there.  Trump won, Clinton lost. Get the fuck over it.
As a Latina I was welcomed here with open arms. After I posted my segment on Hannity, I was quickly invited to do an AMA here, which was wonderful and supportive as always. I did get a few hateful messages that day. One said "how does it feel to be a piece of sh--?" Another said "f--- you Cuban bi---, were deporting you next". You know who those were from? Trump haters. That's right, the only hatred I've gotten has been from tolerant liberals who don't like my opinion and believe all Hispanic people should think the same way. I am honored to be a Centipede and am proud to vouch for the warmth and respect I have seen here. It's not my opinion; it's just the truth. It breaks my heart to see these decent people be slandered across major media publications. Love you guys!  Spez: A couple people msgd about the Hannity segment. Tis here: https://youtu.be/NCiGXQm4S80
I have been apart of this subreddit since day *TWO*.  I've seen literally everything that's come from this subreddit. Everything one can possibly see. We've shitposted our way into history and I've made absolutely amazing friends here.  ...**And now I've been around to see the CEO of a company specifically target a subreddit that goes against his own political views.** I have now seen a CEO that allows pedophiles to talk about some of the most disgusting things I've seen on Reddit. I have now see a CEO stop an investigation that helps stop child abuse.   I didn't think I'd ever see it, but I did. I'm the Ancient Centipede. My based ass has been here through so much stuff that out of everything I've ever seen, this tops them all, and I was a mod on r/pizzagate! I'm a moderator for r/the_book now so all of this bullshit by u/spez can be documented as well as the legendary history of The_Donald.   Our moderators and u/OhSnapYouGotServed have been battling for us day and night. They've done their best for us and they will continue to do so, so I say, as The Ancient Centipede, DO NOT GIVE UP AND DO NOT LET THEM THINK THEY'VE WON.  This is absolutely shameful. u/spez, you will go down as THE WORST Reddit CEO in history and you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself for making Aaron Swartz roll over in his grave. 
I also want Spez to stop telling lies about us.   #r/the_donald has ALWAYS welcomed people from every gender, race and sexual orientation.   Stop trying to gaslight minorities into thinking that half the country is against them for your own personal advantage.   We are all about ❤️ here.
Censoring free speech is the exact reason The Donald won the election. You shall not win spez!
I'M AN ARAB AMERICAN IMMIGRANT, AND THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE IN WESTERN NORTH AMERICA I FEEL ACCEPTED. LIVING IN A LIBERAL CITY, I'M AFRAID TO COMMENT ABOUT MY POLITICAL VIEWS.  I WANT THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING A GREAT COMMUNITY, AND I'M HERE TO HELP MAGA!!!
I'm not a Trump fan, this is my first comment on this sub, but I find myself upvoting 90% of the posts on this subreddit due to how great and logical all of the submissions are.  Rooting for you guys 100%. 
We need to call for u/spez's resignation. This is as bad as Pao
"Free speech is meant to protect unpopular speech. Popular speech, by definition, needs no protection."
He did this because supposedly we were harassing people. Did he provide proof? No, of course not.   We showed proof of Spez editing our comments because that's we always do and that's how we always win. We provide example and indisputable evidence of our claims while they never do.  The burden of proof is never on them and always on us. Now the balls on our side and the burden of proof is on them. Are they gonna make arguments based on reason and evidence? Nope.  They'll just double down and scream even louder because that's all they know how to do. It'll only get worse with these people as they see we won't budge. And they will never look inwards.
Separate, but equal, where have I heard this before?
OH SHIT HERE COME DAT PRESIDENT 
I check out this sub every single day. I don't think I've ever actually seen an actual racist comment made. An actual threat made. A homophobic slur made. Yea, you guys troll hard, make fun of Rachel Maddow being a little boy, call people cuck (aka, weak spineless men ), etc but I don't think I've ever witnessed the types of things people claim this sub does or breaks rules.   Vote manipulation?  Prove it.   Brigading?  Prove it.   If anything, spez's efforts last week prove the system can be manipulated to make something appear real that isnt, and that is a genuine fear. What if someone decides to use that power to make this sub, or any sub, look really bad with fake info, fake / falsified links, accusations, etc just to fit the narrative and get the sub closed.   We have seen it with violent protests that are staged, how would reddit be different.
*First they came for conservative twitter accounts, and I did not speak out—  Because I was not on twitter.*  *Then they came for PizzaGate, and I did not speak out—  Because I was not a sub PizzaGate.*  *Then they came for r/The_Donald, and I did not speak out—  Because I was not a sub r/The_Donald.*   **Then they came for me— and there was no one left to speak for me.**
**/u/SPEZ IS A BULLY AND A TYRANT**
TOU KNOW WHO ELSE SINGLED OUT A COMMUNITY AND QUARANTINED THEM IN CAMPS? HITLER.
This is the same path Newgrounds went down.  It will not end well for reddit.  STA: I've been asked why NG died by a bunch of folks. There are three reasons.  1. The 8 year website cycle. You'll be seeing more about this in the next few years as Youtube, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and others, begin to phase out without real replacements.  2. What extends or protracts the 8 year cycle has a lot to do with available competition. If there's not really any competition, the website will explode until it hits a breaking point. If it has competition, the website will either beat out the competition by allowing freedom of expression or will die off because it didn't.  3. What extends or protracts the life of a website the most is a sense of community as well as a lack of censorship. Reddit is actively destroying both of these things.  What killed NG was a censorship of the Clock meme, the censorship and mass banning of anyone who used, or had ever used the word fag (even mods were banned as a result of this idiocy), and the expulsion of the IRC chat because of speech made against Wade Fulp.  You're seeing very similar things happen on reddit.
Censorship is a hell of a slippery slope. It's us now, it could be anyone next. Time to fight back with Kek and dank memes even more.
Why do the mods never specifically ask about other subs? Spez just dodges the question whenever users ask it, we need a highly upvoted post that says "Spez explain right now why SRS has been allowed to blatantly break and disregard rules for years." Maybe if it was someone other than one of us lowly users asking him he'd finally stop ignoring it and the rest of reddit would see how blatantly full of shit the higher ups at reddit are.
STOP CALLING US RACIST, MISOGYNISTIC,  XENOPHOBIC, TRANSPHOBIC AND ANY OTHER ISM OTHER THAN AMERICAN!

>Back in June when the terrorist attack happened in Orlando, Reddit Inc. decided to punish /r/The_Donald instead of /r/news, which was censoring information on where to donate blood to dying Americans. This time after /u/spez manipulated the Reddit database, Reddit Inc. again decided to punish /r/The_Donald.  #THIS AND THINGS LIKE IT IS A BIG FUCKING REASON BEHIND WHY /R/THE_DONALD EXISTS IN ITS CURRENT WAY SHAPE AND FORM  How fucking hard can this be to understand?
I was one of the first 500 subscribers here, and one of the most active moderators of 2016. No matter what you may do, just remember /u/Spez, we won. Trump won. America won. Your wife's boyfriend won. You did not win. This is our world now. Welcome to your living Hell.

 Hey /u/OhSnapYouGotServed,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
You don't get it.  These people hate you with every fiber of their being because you are in opposition to the ideology that they define themselves by.  These people are physically weak and cowards when it comes to physical violence but they are more fanatical than any jihadist.  Just look at the meltdowns we've seen since the election.  You can't reason, negotiate or bargain with these people.  And ultimately, we're going to have to face the reality that we can't share a nation and be ruled by the same government as them.  In the same vein we can't share a website either.  But do we leave?  No.  We grow until we take over this site.  We make it intolerable to them.  /pol/ has already done this to tumblr and we can do it to reddit because SJW bullshit is so 2015 and we are now.  Do what they do.  Become prominent posters in subreddits and shoot for mod slot.  Invade, influence, lobby and conquer.  They do this to every online community they touch.  We can do it too.  They're over at voat.co right now trying this very thing.  We can't convert these people.  We have to defeat these people.

Hey Spez, if you want to see what harassment looks like go anonymously try to engage the users on /r/redacted in a pro-Trump discussion.
[deleted]
The rest of reddit so Low Energy. I'm surprised they were supporting Bernie and not Jeb.
fuck u/spez  Censorship is not the answer.  Don't you get it?  These types of things only make us stronger in the end. 
What this means is that the same standards that apply to r/The_Donald should apply to all of the left-wing echo chambers as well (ETS, SRS, etc).  If admins are incapable of being impartial, than they need to not be admins.
Hey u/spez, **How do these natural votes taste?**
they dont care at this point. probably rejoicing in thinking they have 'won' with cuck boys recent statement. why need facts when you can stick your fingers in your ears and  ####ignore. ignore. ignore.   #SAD
I honestly believe no T_D members would message Spaz support. He must've edited the PMs.
6,000 points 63% upvoted. They. Just. Don't. Get It.   **WE WANT PEACE AND FREEDOM**
Let this be a lesson to you all, it doesn't matter how "anti-racist" and tolerant you are, if you disagree with the left they will call you a nazi and shut down your free speech. Hell, even if youre a leftist who isn't 110% on board with the latest social justice issue, you will be purged.  Don't even try to please them, it will never work.
So I'll be honest... I disagree with just about every opinion you guys have, and I've found all your antics mildly annoying.   That being said, forcing your opinion to be hidden because we don't like it is just plain wrong. This is definitely a wrong move by /u/spez and the rest of reddit.
I'm a Muslim American with Trumpesque views and I can't discuss it with my most liberal friends. No one should feel like they can't say what they feel. #MAGA
# FIRST THEY CAME FOR PEPE ### And I did not speak out, because I was not a Pepe # THEN THEY CAME FOR DAT BOI ### And I did not speak out, because I was not Dat Boi
Anyone with a moral compass should see how blatantly wrong this behavior is. Agree with this sub-reddit or not the behavior of the admins is troubling and shady.

/u/OhSnapYouGotServed - I love you 
When there are verified operations with unknown users who spread disinformation, and incite racist comments with the intention of deriding a group..  It is a preconception to assume liability on an entire sub community.  And we all know what the first three letters of A$$ume are..  We must raise the bar in the face of low energy, please help ensure decorum and fellowship, even though we might disagree with what you say. We would fight for your right to say it.  Remember the level of class and character expected of us, we have a monumental task ahead helping those get over the gut punch feeling this election may seem to have been.  Either you love this Country, or you don't. It's an amazing starting point for any conversation. Even if someone does not seem to understand at first, does not mean they won't understand in time.  My fellow Americans, it has been an honor and a privilege spending many countless hours with you all. There is a better way, and we must find common ground and work together to make this happen.  Never give up, you will never know how much you might have won. -Donald J. Trump
I wanted to paste this; I had it typed up then someone either deleted their comment or they got banned:  We don't claim to be anything but one sided. Politics, on the other hand, claims to be a place where you can openly discuss politics. However, one post that sways a little to the right is met with five smug and demeaning responses. No sources, no citations, smugness. We don't claim to be fair, it's stated in the rules that followers here are to support Trump. If I go into r/Hillaryclinton and post some bullshit hatred there, they would ban me. People like you propose that if you can't come at us an attack us, you will either change algorithms or ban is altogether. Believe me though, you wouldn't be saying all of this is Trump didn't win, and yes.  DONALD J. TRUMP IS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. The sea of red tells me, and everyone else that we are sick and tired of being manipulated by sites and outlets that claim to be balanced but are attempting to condition and distract our population.   Believe me, I post on the_donald and I do not get banned for disagreeing with somebody. So, because you disagree with us you think we shouldn't be around. That doesn't make any sense. When all else fails, censor the opposition.   The truth does exist here. Wikileaks, election forecasting, calling the propaganda narrators out, and showing people the truth happens here. Go to politics when Wikileaks came out. Go to politics the night of the election. Go to politics two weeks before the election. Go to politics when the wikileaks emails indicated that Hillary cheated to be the nominee.   Seriously, go look for yourself. They lie, deceit, and are brainwashed. Not us. Our guy won. And we helped. So you want to shut us down. Makes a lot of sense.

I'm half Hispanic but keep getting told I'm in the KKK white supremacist uneducated blah blah you all know the rest. It gets old but we are not whinny bitches over here and know that words don't hurt.
Liberals:  we want equality for everyone.  Except if they disagree with us.  
Im a Pakistani ex muslim and I feel more welcome here than any of your little 'liberal' subreddits. Fuck u/spez
I'm sick and tired of being a mixed male, married to a mixed woman and being told I'm racist and bigoted because I am a common sense conservative who energetically supported r/T_D and DJT himself. I grew up as a minority is a small town where over 95% of people are white. Both my wife and I are children of first generation immigrants, but we are constantly told by our tolerant left friends how we benefitted from white privileged and that we're racist. It's so backwards, I'm not sure how anyone with two brain cells to rub together can't see through the logical fallacies of the tolerant left. This censorship of t_d is just another example of how they want to brainwash the world to agree with them and only them, all in the name of diversity!!!!
shenanigans like these is what made me quit HRC in September and join the centipede in November.   I was late to the emperor's party but my zeal for purging the heretics is just as strong. Choo choo motherfuckers. 
Ah I see you need a little help getting this to the top, here's an upvote!
Yeah, I'll probably just go somewhere new if this becomes a trend.

WE JUST WANT EQUALITY
You either have political subreddits or non at all.   You cannot have one sided echo chamber and still call yourself American or [insert progressive country here].   Progressive used to be about free speech. Used to.. 
I had to delete my account of six years after being doxxed by CTR and SRS.  What did I do to deserve this? I made a joke in r/REDACTED about the main stream media's fawning support for Hillary Clinton.   I had letters sent to my employer accusing me of being a racist. I never said anything about race.  Six years of relationships, karma, post history, insightful comments -- all of it down the drain because I said one thing contrary to the narrative.   r/The_Donald did not appear out of nowhere. So many conservatives and nationalists are sick and tired of being bullied and harassed and driven out of conversation for stating opinions that are NOT racist, xenophobic, sexist, but that have simply been snipped off the end of the Overton window.   People today must fear for their jobs and be silent or else anonymous simply for espousing opinions that were MAINSTREAM and considered reasonable just five years ago. Obama and Hillary Clinton themselves were opposed to gay marriage less than a decade ago. Now, you can be driven from your job and hounded into poverty for so much as saying that marriage is, at its root, a religious institution.   When I first started reading reddit in 2008, I was not considered a "deplorable". I was considered liberal. I fell to the left of most discussion. Nowadays I am considered a "white supremacist" and a "neo-nazi" -- but my opinions and perspectives have not changed that much. What HAS changed is the window of what is considered an "allowed" opinion. That window has moved so far left that it's now considered OK to praise communist dictators, and not OK to wave an american flag.   I used to be a progressive because I opposed Bush's wars, and wanted to bring jobs back to americans, and supported the working class. Now opposing foreign intervention makes me a "Russian agent" and opposing globalism and outsourcing makes me a xenophobe and a racist.   The same WTO protesters that used to riot against globalist corporatism now riot against blue collar workers because they're "uneducated racists" who want to work for a living rather than collect welfare, rape kids, and paint fucked up pictures in their spare time.  It's now considered unacceptable to not be a leech. I was between jobs recently and when someone found out that I hadn't claimed unemployment benefits during that time (I had savings) they called me "part of the problem".  I have watched my community go from safe and productive to full of crime and dependence in less than 15 years, and I'M the enemy because I ask why. Bullshit.  If half of the users who make up the status-quo liberal hive-mind actually looked at their own opinions and perspectives they would realize that they have gone from being reasonable freedom-minded intellectuals with a penchant for equal opportunity to being flat-out social puritans who spout marxist propaganda like it was normal.  It's not normal. You've gone insane. You're losing your minds.  WAKE THE FUCK UP!  You just spent three days calling Castro a hero while simultaneously accusing every single Trump appointee of being a secret Nazi.

**MAKE REDDIT GREAT AGAIN!!(For once)**
Interesting that I have never seen anyone here calling for a ban on any other subreddit, only for a chance to have our posts be seen by others.  But all the enemies of this sub are constantly calling for a ban on T_D with no proof that they are breaking any rules.  Its sick really how they just want to stamp out the political viewpoint that won the elections this year because they can't deal with it the conventional ways.  They are losing and desperate and see that silencing the opposition is their only chance left.  The opposition is not one to be silenced though they will learn soon enough.
The simple fact is that the_donald has a tendency to pierce the veil of propagandizing and group think the msm and social media, and for that matter reddit, are a part of. Our shitposting is us climbing down into the allegorical cave and taking peoples' attention away from the shadow show.   People like /u/spez (fuck u/spez ) *need* to prevent us from communicating with the people who haven't been brought out of the cave yet. 
I have a site DonaldTrumpChat dot com.  With the antics of Reddit's CEO this site will continue even if he shuts down The Donald and bans pro Trump users.  I encourage all of you to also post to this site and use the chat room (sign up required) in parallel with The Donald to hedge our resources.
I will stop complaining when the rules that are applied to us are applied sitewide. Until then, however, we will fight for our right to free speech.   It has become abundantly clear that they wish to slowly drive us away from reddit with arbitrary rules rather than outright deleting our domreddit. They ban us from their subreddits, and when we create our own domreddits to counter they ban those as well. This is a war of attrition, and they believe we will "run out of steam."   *leans into mic*   Wrong.   We are just getting started.   This is the domreddit for THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. We will continue growing for a minimum of eight more years, and their foreign investors are trying to stop that.   At this point, these actions against us in collusion with foreign entities is nothing short of treason.   I suggest all centipedes send one articulate and well-reasoned suggestion letter to [GreatAgain.gov](http://www.greatagain.gov/) in regards to this despicable situation. I would also suggest reaching out to people such as Tucker Carlson and Joe Scarborough in order to bring mainatream media attention to these actions against us.   We must fight them with facts, and we must fight them on their own turf.   Reddit is the 27th most accessed site on the internet, and to suggest that we simply abandon any place that disagrees with us is ludicrous.   That is not victory, that is retreat.   The only way to win is to beat them at their own game.   We did it at the voting booths, and it is time to do it on the internet as well.   NEVER GIVE UP   NEVER SURRENDER   NEVER GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT   #WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED   So long as we stand together, we are unstoppable. We proved that on November 8th and we will prove it again here.   Just try and stop us.   Edit: /u/ApathyOwl makes [a great point.](http://reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5fte99/first_they_came_for_us_is_your_community_next/damwhmq) We must beat them at their own game if we are to survive this culture war.
This whole thing is ridiculous. I dislike Trump for numerous reasons.  But u/spez censoring and singling out this community has gone over the top. I'm now a subscriber.

If anything Reddit will go towards the Digg route or Newgrounds route which will destroy Reddit because of fuck tard CEOs and admins who run the site. 
**THIS POST HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE MINISTRY OF SPEZ. PLEASE WAIT AND THE REEDUCATION SQUAD WILL ARRIVE SHORTLY**
u/ohsnapyougotserved    We should only allow r/the_donald subscribers to upvote/downvote posts, like r/[redacted] does. They did it to prevent non-subscribers from downvoting their ultra-leftist bullshit, and we can do the same.      Anyone upvoting our posts is most likely a subscriber to our glorious domreddit, so it's a win-win: if they want to downvote our posts into invisibility, they'll have to be a subscriber. It'll help shield cuckery from our upvote:downvote ratio and it'll boost our subscriber count, making admins more reluctant to further censor us

This is absolutely unacceptable on the part of /u/spez and Reddit.  The recent moves made against this sub are unprovoked.  This subreddit has done nothing wrong and is being targeted.  FUCK /u/spez
I'm American born in Hong Kong and have been lurking on t_d for over a year before joining reddit recently. There is no racist shit here. We are family, this is the only forum I've been on that actually feels like a extended family.  Btw, were getting over 500 subscribers per hr the last three hrs I've checked, thanks /u/spez.  Actually scratch that, fuck /u/spez.
I do not necessarily agree with everything you guys say, but god damn you guys should have the right to do it. As Voltaire famously once said "Fuck Spez".
He added a filter feature to r/all? I didn't even realize that. What's the point of that sub then? 
I feel u/spez is really single out everyone who enjoys this Reddit and I feel a bit harassed and judged reading that announcement from him. It does suck but this Domreddit will still be strong and even more stronger.
If our voice is being silenced on the_donald, then its time we took our voice to other subreddits.  PS: You cant call me for asking for brigading if i dont name any subreddits.
Why does it say "delete this" on the tabs for this sub?
I like how we can easily bypass the sticky ban by just posting the best links at the top of this subreddit in that header space
Wow, everyone is in support of him, too.  The notable takeaways: Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all Users can choose to filter out t_d and never see it in r/all  So he apologized for editing but still blocked us and called us bullies anyway.
Here is an image of an already unconscious Trump supporter being brutally beaten @ UC Berkeley. Not that anyone on Reddit cares.
[Liberal tolerance​](http://i.magaimg.net/img/17p.png)    EDIT: [Updated, some sick leftist fucks on reddit](http://i.magaimg.net/img/185.png) 
In the attacker's defense, the alleged receiver of undocumented touching looks like he might be guilty of being a white male.
if you saw this happening and shot them so the man being beaten wouldnt die, would you go to jail?  it would be defense of another right?
He was beat up but these people dressed like ISIS carrying sticks? This shit is unbelievable. Where are the fucking national guard?
Have you heard anything?  There are a few 'pedes wondering how bad the injuries were, etc.

Attacking a down man is attempted murder in my book.
Liberal here.  I care.  Violent behaviour is abhorrent, regardless of one's political allegiances.
We will never forget this. Ever. 
Reddit is completely oblivious to everything at the moment except for anti-Trump propaganda or some picture of a millennial/Muslim shithead holding an incredibly unoriginal sign that usually involves bashing Trump in some way
That city and school are going to get the sued into bankrupcy. You know their are cops that where told to stand down that are eager to testify against their regressive Leftists overlords. 
#Arrest the cowards
Any legal recourse...sue UC Berkeley?... The administration of Berkeley?   The mayor?
I have heard multiple 'news stories' on the radio today not only ignoring the actual violence and damage caused by these rioters, but also defending the protest ("only 500 people wanted to see that troll"--- so now freedom of speech isn't worth protecting if only a few hundred people are interested???!!!), and praising the police for 'not hurting people' (never mind that those 'people' are the ones violently acting out and causing destruction). Furthermore, it's simply 'a shame' that the damage leaked off the campus and affected local businesses. Furthermore, Trump is 'viciously attacking' and 'threatening' Berkeley for 'no reason.'   These people are chronic liars, and it's so frustrating to know that I'm surrounded by intolerant assholes that actually agree with the actions of these violent individuals.   Imagine for two seconds that instead of a conservative gay man, a feminist woman (of any color) was met with the same reaction. The news would be calling for arrests, fines, and launch an endless witch hunt for the next month. Every day it's easier and easier for even the most tuned out people to see the hypocrisy of these shit stained rainbow freaks.
Only 55 percent upvote.   Reddit is a sick, sick place these days.
Why do you need a gun? The police will protect you! 
I'm tired of people saying "if I was there I would of..."  if you see anything like this, you are there, DO SOMETHING AND HELP THEM
Serious question. Where are the Left's leaders in condemning this brutal violence?  Where's Bernie or Warren or Schumer telling their followers not to condone or support these anarchists?  Their lack of leadership and silence is a tacit approval of the fascist behavior of those claiming to be stopping fascism. This shit has got to stop. 
Honestly I place most of the blame on the media for all of this.  If you believed everything the media spews about Trump you should be rioting.  The media makes him out to be Satan himself.  
Violence doesn't trigger these new liberals. Hurt feelings do.
I never thought George Soros would pay antifa enough to do this shit in America. This is not Europe. The push back against these 90lb blue haired cunts is going to be far more than they can handle.

Man globalisation is a fucking joke, if you can't even get people in the same country to express themselves peacefully, how the fuark do you expect people of different faith different ideologies  to come together.
All because trump wants to lower the average man's taxes and keep sharia law loving muzzies out.
Fucking cowards. 
They care, they just largely support it because they're a bunch of fascist lefties. 
We absolutely care. This is unacceptable and un-American.
Liberals are really becoming the American ISIS, "live your life our way and see society the way we see it or we will use violence to make you do it our way anyway." I mean, to their credit, they aren't chopping off heads or throwing people off buildings....yet, though I'm sure plenty would if they thought they could get away with it.
He doesn't agree with me and he's outnumbered let's punish him - sounds very close to how those cowards in Isis think to me folks. 
Literally fascism. This is what the greatest generation fought against. Disgraceful pieces of human trash.
There was a time I wanted to go to Berkeley.  fucking dug up bombs over seas to come back to people savagely beating eachother for the reason of having a different opinion.  Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.    We no longer deserve this country and if shit like this continues we won't have it anymore.
Just the latest in a wave of leftist violence that's swept the nation since the summer.   This is what happens when you tell the world: that everyone who voted Trump is a racist and fascist,  that [red hats are literal swastikas](https://i.redd.it/79h7e6eqrccy.jpg), that the [End of the Republic is upon us](http://i.magaimg.net/img/18b.jpg) (ok it's a silly example but I can't help but laughing at an ex-CIA dude writing that), that [violence is acceptable](https://twitter.com/prisonplanet/status/827210134749380608) if the target is a ["nazi"](http://i.magaimg.net/img/bf.png), that we ought to [consider a violent coup](https://www.google.com/amp/www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/02/02/ex-obama-official-suggests-military-coup-trump/amp/?client=safari) (as an Obama staffer recently considered), that [words are literal violence, so literal violence is no different than words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGtI3Ezdvo), and that pro-Trump hate is on the rise ([is it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5km8pm/list_of_confirmed_hate_hoaxes_is_growing_big/)).

You see this Reddit? This is you. This is what your policies and agendas and propaganda have caused. Keep trying to call conservatives the bad guys. *THIS* speaks for itself. 
Political violence in America is almost entirely left to right. Obama was safe in racist heavily armed evil America. Trump is absolutely not safe. People wearing Trump hats are not safe.  The aggressively biased CNN narrative has been that Trump and Trump supporters are racist. An evil white supremacist movement. And they know it's an evile white supremacist movement, because intolerant low-road leftists have been beating themselves and up screaming that Trump did it. Burning their own churches down and yelling Trump did it. Some disgusting lowlife says her Islamic slave-costume was tugged on, and CNN yelled "Stop the presses!".  Don't read the Hillary emails, because, that's illegal... Trump gets pee'd on in Russia, can't be President.  It's a pleasure watching them spiral down the toilet bowl replaced by New Media. And the silver lining is that doing all this in the information age, their hate movement, has exposed them forever. 12 year olds will watch the video of this guy getting his head smashed in by violent hate screeching animals, and it will be *sooo* much harder for CNN and our schools to dupe them.  Hillary had less support from Generation Z than she did from Millennials. That might be unprecedented that the younger generation is less likely to support the more liberal candidate. It's because Millennials were duped before youtube was popular. Before wikipedia is what it is now. Before Twitter.  With New Media, and Trump giving us school choice, we'll be out of danger of another Hillary forever.
I just commented this but it's worth saying again.   **DON'T BE STUPID! DON'T STOOP TO THEIR LEVEL.**  They are currently shooting themselves in the foot. Yelling about how violent Trump supporters are while you're beating someone with a sign is pretty ridiculous, even for the left. Let them continue to be whacko's and continue on being a normal human. Smile at those you meet, say sir and ma'am, even if they are being insulting. Actions speak louder than words. If you act like a regular human and then they beat people in the streets, anyone on the fence has but one direction to lean. 
Tolerant young liberals being tolerant 
Why aren't the major figureheads of the Democratic party  (Obama, Clinton, Sanders) speaking out against this kinda action? They have to know what's going on, where are they? So sickening.

Not a Trump fan by any means but I find it disgusting people are resorting to violence and shit like this because someone is of another political affiliation. This was a stupid ass move because now it's only going to divide people even more. Not sure how this sub would react if it was a solely peaceful protest but we will never know.  I hope the dude is okay. I don't care who is on which side, hurting someone like that because of their ideals is SHITTY AND WRONG.
This kind of bullshit could only happen at a leftist haven like Berkeley. It's a giant gun-free zone. These terrorists know nothing will happen to them. Let these people try this in any non-cucked city. They'd get their comeuppance. An armed society is a polite society.

Anarchists need to be labeled as terrorists quick.
I'd consider myself to be independent but left of center, and I must say that I completely agree with you all. This attack on this Trump supporter is completely disgusting, and I'm deeply bothered that it's not being covered more in the media. At some point, many liberal media outlets need to set aside their political plans and pause to recognize the common humanity we all share. I hope none of you ever experience this kind of violence in any free speech context like this. It would be my fervent wish that people would stand up to protect you from harm like this, whether or not they disagree with your ideas. Just horrible. 
There was plenty of publicity surrounding this event and a great likelihood of this being a civil unrest flash-point. The police where hiding inside and did nothing, thereby complicit in their actions - allowing this to happen, apparently this can only happen with the instruction of the Mayor or Police chief. Heads need to roll.
For me what was really scary was in the video you can hear continuously screams to beat the man, even after he has fallen to the ground.
God damnit this makes me so fucking mad.  I'm glad I am not standing in front of any of these people right now because I would be going to prison.
This kind of shit is why magazine size restrictions are retarded. Need more than 10 rounds in a magazine to defend against these anarchist cowards. 
Phew. I thought I was the only conservative thinker on this whole site. 
Here's one group that doesn't care, MSM. Even NYT had the headline 'protesters start fires, throw things'   They simply can be trusted to report actual news that is counter to the narrative they created.
Hmmmm Anti-Fascists, or are these liberals fascists? So hard to tell what the real truth is...
#THE NORTH REMEMBERS
Time to denounce the whole left. No more arguments. They're the enemy.
Copied from a page I follow, funny how the libtards are the same no what the geography  "Liberal logic - if you do it, it is intolerance and obstructionism, if I do it, it is resistance. If you speak it is hate speech and bigotry hence should be banned, if I resort to violence against that, it is a fundamental right"
Fucking white male! Look at him being all oppressive and shit.
msm: HEY LOOK AT TRUMP'S SCHWARZENEGGER JAB AT THE PRAYER BREAKFAST!  (buries evidence of their own violence)
The left... so tolerant right now...
Kinda looks like attempted murder, first degree assault at the minimum. Did the cops do anything? Nope there has only been 1 arrest despite UC Berkeley chancelllor saying there were 150 violent rioters among the demonstrators.  The cops had flaming projectiles lobbed at them, again a serious felony, however they did nothing but watch. This crowd has demonstrated that they are above the law.  Oh and it's laughable that the Berkeley mayor then tweeted a tip line for reporting crimes. As if the terrorists will be able to be identified now, whereas it would have been very easy to make a case when caught in the act. Remember these acts were committed in front of dozens of duly sworn law enforcement officers
Nothing to see here folks.... standard ANTIFA operating procedure. The "tolerant" liberals strike again.

"There we were...Tuesday, November 8 2016...E day...round' 06:00 r/politics came in hard with a left flank shitstorm...them and CTR was makin' a mess of r/HillaryForPrison ...things were lookin' bad...real bad...least til the garrison arrived...that was us...r/the_donald... dank memes and shitposts were flyin' left and right, but we were giving em' hell...they almost got poor pepe..the bastards... wasn't till around 16:00 til /pol/ got in the fight, and we was able to show them bastards what REAL shitposin' was all about....I reckon that's what finished em' off...yup...them was the glory days..."

I wasn't a Meme Lord, but I fought in the company of Meme Lords.
I don't know if the normies are aware of this. Pol, this domreddit and generally right leaning online Communities from the "dark corners" of the internet, many of them not in English, played a very significant part in this election. Trump is absolutely unironically a meme president. Think a bit further now... this makes us a threat. I sure as shit am glad that Trump won this. Clinton would've shut us down immediately, because we would've made her intended victory difficult.   The normies will spin their "muh Russia haxxors" meme, but we did this. And I'm not sure how they will react when they understand this. 
I don't want anything from this crooked site that censored news and protected warmongering criminals.  Reddit and spez can eat my poo.
Jesus, you think that reddit cuck would even bend the knee?
Brexiteers say hi.
Been here since we were a tiny 3000 sub. Now we have exploded and memed Trump into the white house! Couldn't be more proud seeing our baby (r/the_donald) turn into what it is today!
#WE DID IT REDDIT  Holy fucking shit
8 YEARS OF THIS  I'M CUMMING SO HARD  HOLD ME I'M SO HAPPY
It really did feel like a war
HRC memes were weak and forced. Our memes were from the most brilliant autist. She never had a chance.  
#FUCK IT, LETS MAKE OUR OWN TROHPY.
America don't even know the counter psy-ops battle that went on behind the scenes. The fact that a non paid group of patriots battled CTR agents,  MSM media, rigged polls while being censored...and WON. It was a fierce battle at all fronts, from the okeefes, assanges, and the memes.

I hope it's signed by all the Admins from /r/Redacted and the Reddit Admins that tried to fuck over /r/The_Donald.
The Great Meme War.
[deleted]
I'm so happy I can be pro Trump without being downvoted here. I told some people that this place is good because there is no r/The_Hillary, but r/The_Donald exists. I got downvoted. <3
Didnt r/sweden smash you in the first meme war. This must be MW2
We really do have the best memes
Whoa, I want a CNN mug right now.  To be sipping from one at work this very moment...
We already had a meme war with r/sweden last spring.  P.S. Yes, I fought on your side believe it or not.
The memes were dank. I think this will start a trend and all future elections will be decided by meme wars.
GMWOT Ribbon awarded.  Global meme war on Terror. 
There needs to be a museum thread of the most heroic and decisive memes from the war. 
Proud veterans of Meme War 1
Amazing that CTR is still downvoting posts. They lost. Why don't they just fuck off already?
r/The_Donald is still the first place I check. I will never forget the suppression of comments and upvotes from reddit. 
My grandchildren will ask "Grandpa, were you a hero in the meme war?" And I'll say "No, but I served with a company of heroic shitposters"
Fucking hell, we did it though
congratulation /r/Donald  meme magic is real. They should have left us in the chans
They should add a little MAGA hat or Pepe next to your username to show you were part of r/the_donald for election.
/u/spez should commission a small Snoo trophy with /r/The_Donald on it and send every member of this sub an individual code to login online to a website and order one AT NO CHARGE!  
i count all the 'we'll see you november 9th' smug messages in my inbox as a trophy, in fact, I count each one as a separate trophy
"There's one thing you men will be able to say when this Meme War is over and you get back home. Thirty years from now when you're sitting by your fireside with your grandson on your knee and he asks, 'What did you do in the great Meme War Two?' You won't have to cough and say, 'Well, your granddaddy shoveled shitposts for CTR.' No sir, you can look him straight in the eye and say 'Son, your granddaddy rode with the great Centipede Army and a son-of-a-goddamned-bitch named Donald J Trump!'  All right, you sons of bitches. You know how I feel. I'll be proud to lead you wonderful guys in battle anytime, anywhere. That's all"
This is Trump's America.  NO PARTICIPATION TROPHIES.
#I DONT WANT A TROPHY FROM U/SPEZ
That cup should say, "CNN Tears"
MEME WAR ll: The Fall of SPEAKER RYAN  You know what to do.
I agree, Major KEK.
At least some sort of super ultra rare limited edition flair. "Meme War I Veteran"
Seriously, I SERVED MY SUBREDDIT, i paid the price for these centipedes
Seriously, I still fucking cannot believe this.  WE MEMED A MAN TO THE WHITE HOUSE.  Did we shift to some sort of a bizarro timeline after Brexit?
We need our own Ministry of Meme Magic. We have unearthed some power stuff.
Realistically, how much did we and pol matter? I think it's quite a bit but I'd have trouble backing up such a claim empirically 
Nah, you lost the first meme war to r/sweden
I want Trump hair on my cursor
A meme NEEDS to be made out of this picture
I'm looking through a lot of the known tendies subs. Guys. This salt level could very well season our food for MILLENNIA to come!
Campaign medals. 
There should definitely be some recognition of some kind. Even if it's just a nod from the Don himself. This sub could very well have been what pushed him across the finish line.
We won Trump
gg no re
Actually, it was more like a blitzkrieg. They didn't stand a chance.
I assume Donald's drinking the salty tears of CNN?
Friend, every single upvote you have earned in this dom reddit shall serve as a badge of honor.
Saviors of the damn country?
I've a got a better one. Reddit gold, "for turning this pile of shit of a website into something actually productive."
Give my medal, if I even deserve one to Seth Rich.....
Permanent flair pls

"Grandpa, where were you during the first meme war?"  Single tear rolls down cheek. 
I remember our battle against /r/sweden and /r/all 
So... Trumps victory wasn't due to policy, or Hillary's shortcomings, it was down to shitposting?
Thank you r/The_Donald. Trump would not have won it without you!
Soldier for over a year. I would like that.
Totally. I feel, I really feel that Trump might have lost this, were it not for us.  Although I though if it would have been harder for him, he'd just have won even bigger.
With campaign ribbons for each stage of the primary. 
Order of Kek, 2nd Class 
Guys... I forgot to ask for a coat. Is it too late?
You get a brick icon next to your name.
Thanks be to all of our 400lb hackers
Can we take a moment to appreciate /u/spez's role in helping polarize the community by accepting Liberal money in exchange for upholding an anti-Trump agenda?   /u/spez helped create this movement against his Liberal following and the irony that what was once a troll sub becoming a beacon and hub for a radical awakening.  Thanks for eating liberal dick /u/spez! You helped make this possible!
but OP! We already did. And in a couple months hel be sworn into office, working hard to #MAGA!
Like a badge on our Reddit profile.
Presidency of USA not enough for you?  Jeez, hard to please, aren't we?
I'll accept one imprisoned Hillary
Pepe campaign ribbons for all who fought in the Meme War.
Every one of us deserves to take a bow. Every Pepe posting. Every reply to $hillary's twitter. Every post of Robert Byrd.  There's a fantastic Twitter account called "Hillary's PR Team".  @onmessageforher, with a Hillary forward logo.  For 18 months, this has been an in character troll account saying things like "Yes, Hillary has a set of laws all for herself, but the blue-collar American knows it's for their own good!" or "Trump is crazy. Now let's stop Putin from hacking our entire election from the inside out!"  Yesterday, I woke up, and the logo was just a straight-up Trump logo with a tweet that said:  "God bless Donald Trump."  I actually teared up reading it.  The mask is lifted. This is it. The war is finally being fought today. We're all in it together now. I've shit-posted all over Twitter for the past 18 months. I've upvoted every Pepe I could get my hands on. I dug deep into what Spirit Cooking is, for God's sake.  We've had some casualties in this meme war. Milo. Ricky Vaughn. But now we're on the front lines to fight the greatest threat the country has ever seen.  God bless Donald Trump.  Let's fucking make America great again.
Even though I didn't contribute much to the sub in the sense of content, only by upvotes and the occasional comment, I do consider myself part of this movement. MAGA! I've been an afterberner but the passion Trump shows for his country just... kinda moved me. Long may every single one of you guys and girls here live and FUCK the people who ban us from their subs just for being part of this... and /u/spez, fuck you too.
It would be my first...
Does it count as a war if it's only one side?
True that
Trump winning is our trophy
The Great Meme War...but is it really a war when the other side is completely unarmed?
OHIO
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"Ohio has chosen the last 13 elections"   Just thought I'd throw this in here. Congrats Ohio, MAGA

Holy shit. Hillary Clinton came into my room to bring me a jar of pickles and I literally screamed at her and hit the jar of pickles out of her hand. She started to have a seizure and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do about the barbells that keep falling on me. I didn't mean to do that to Hillary but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is she losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe Trump knows how to campaign without celebrities. I want to be culturally enriched by refugees. I want Hillary to be president and let in more refugees. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought they were correcting the record???? This is so fucked.

I told him he won't just randomly nuke people then he called Trump a dumbfuck and said the alt right did this all.  I told him Hillary is a piece of shit who stole the primary from Bernie (who he voted for) and that hes on his knees for her now is pathetic.  This stumpening is amazing.
So proud of my state. I stood in the rain holding a flag and a Trump sign today. Trying to drum up those last votes in Lake County.

I just don't understand why people say Europe needs more diversity. There's slavs, germanic, celtic, nordic, latin...  Wtf
I am a nursing manager in a hospital. Last two weeks I fired a blond nurse first, and two days ago an African American aid... All of her friends claim racism.  It doesn't matter she didn't show up to work on time, even after allowed to come at 7:30, half an hour later than anyone else. That was done to accommodate her child care needs. At best she made it at 8:15, for months.  Then we gave her a chance to move to 3-11, shift and she was late again, every single time.  She didn't do her charting, and was warned multiple times for that too.  The final straw was when she didn't follow policy while providing care on a kid, and caused for a gastric tube to dislodge.  Still, I am the racist.
Man the left camp has been so racist towards whites. I only see one side explicitly calling out one race. 
Serious question here, what laws are there in place that are suppressing any freedoms for minorities? I can't think of any. However, I do know about affirmative action and how colleges and some jobs have racial quotas they have to make which give an ADVANTAGE to minorities over whites and asians.
Lifelong democrat, used to believe Bill Maher's 'not all republicans are racist. But, if you're racist, you're probably a republican' like it was gospel.   As I got older it became painfully obvious that the race issue was being kept alive by people like Stephen Colbert, who intentionally slapped the republican's hands away whenever they tried to reach out and make people feel welcome. [1](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/7543m5/the-colbert-report-the-gop-convention---mitt-romney-s-minority-appeal) [2](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/asy3gz/the-colbert-report-mitt-romney-s-hispanic-outreach)  They need it to stay alive; otherwise, they'll start losing again. What they didn't realize, people eventually become immune to bullshit. Now they're losing anyway.
Agreeing with many others here. We're not klansmen, we're not neo-nazis. And we don't have to denounce anything else.  We're not the anti-racism police, and we shouldn't be. Are you behaving legally? Are you assimilated? Are you a nationalist? Are you more concerned for the citizens in your country than illegals or everyone else outside of it? Then you're good, and questions about whether or not you're "racist" don't mean shit.  Fuck crying "racism". Fuck denouncing "racism". The racism/misogyny wars are over, and the people screaming "racist!" and "misogynist!" lost. Let's move on.
"Treated equally" is precisely the point.  I am fine with equal treatment under the law.  I am fine with equality of opportunity.  I am not fine with affirmative action, I am not fine with hiring quotas, and I am not fine with diversity virtue signaling.  And I'm extra not fine with BLM burning down American cities because some drug dealer gets killed.  What I'm not fine with is the left's idea of equality.  Equality of outcome.

I am proud to be white. That doesn't make me racist 
the Leftists NEVER need to "prove" they are not racist  The Leftists are NEVER expected to denounce racism  They have created a false narrative where they are not racist and where Repubicans/Trump supporters are.  When we go out of our way to prove that we're not racist, its like we are buying into their altered and dishonest reality.  Of course we're not racist, but we don't have to prove it (to them, or anyone else).  You see, thats the difference between Trump and almost every other Republican.  He just ignored this liberal trap.  When Trump was accused of racism by the leftists (just like they do to every single republican, ever) he didn't back off, apologize, feel any need to explain himself, or beg them for forgiveness.  He knew he wasn't racist, and as such he didn't feel any need to apologize for anything (why should he?)   Point being, post like this one, while accurate, are still playing into a dishonest liberal narrative that Republicans are racist,  And part of that narrative is there to make us jump through all sorts of hoops to "prove" we are not the racists that they (falsely) claim we are.  All of this is just a distraction from the real deal, which is that Republicans/Trump supporters are not racist at all, and that liberals are the real racists.  Trump showed us how to do it, and that is not explain ourselves, but rather just move full speed ahead knowing that we're in the right.
I am white and I am a nationalist. Is that still cool with you guys or should I leave?
I really don't like virtue signaling, It attracts lazy asshole from the left who are easily swayed by pretty words and desirable yet unrealistic ideals. I'm not saying I don't agree with the statement just that I hate the kind of shit that gets drug in on people's heels.

The amount of people I've encountered over the past week who truly believe you can't be racist to a white person is unbelievable.
I don't think white ethnonationalists nor white identitarians are necessarily racist. Every other race is allowed and encouraged to think in terms of what will benefit themselves and their broader racial tribe consisting of sufficiently similar ethnicities, whites should be no different. Whites are a global minority and there is no sound reason why they shouldn't think in terms of their own best interests too. This isn't mutually exclusive with basic respect and the affordance of the same protections of the law to other races, nor necessitates prejudice.
Honestly thought I wouldn't be called a racist in my life before this movement began. Oh boy, the amount of times I've been called it just for supporting Trump. Disgusting. Trump is for all.
Can we start by abolishing affirmative action programs please?
[deleted]
>calling Ethnonationalists racist  Absolutely not. Not every country is a multicultural experiment. Not every native people want to be slowly replaced by constant immigration.  England literally means 'land of the Angles'. Which is an Ethnic group.  Ethnonationalism is perfectly normal and natural, and the vast majority of countries are named after their majority ethnic group. It is racism to demand we sacrifice our values or be called 'racist'.
You had me at "White Ethnonationlist".  I've met these people, they're not evil like you say they are, and I'm a minority. 
As long as you keep letting 'racist' get under your skin they will continue to use it against you.
Can we stop defending our self from libtards, let them keep screaming racism we dont have to keep making post about it.
Damn right!  This is Donald Trump's America and all people are equal before the eyes of the law.  Meritocracy motherfuckers!
Can't someone just love their country and want to put it above everyone else's without being called a "racist"?
[deleted]
Do we really need to point this out? God emperor himself had been very clear on this. Judge people by merit, not by their race or gender or whatever the fuck else.
The doctrine of white privilege and white guilt is by definition racism.
90% of racism I see comes from the left.   http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/085/249/d7c.png  I'm British, currently living in Asia. In the UK if you fly the British flag people genuinely you as a racist (or a bit weird). In Asia flags are everywhere, on roads, buildings, peoples homes.. people are proud of their country, their people, everything. Such a contrast.

>ethnic nationalism  >racist  Cultural Marxism everyone. Prime example right here.
I honestly believe that 99%+ of Trump supporters want nothing but prosperity and opportunity for all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, etc.  This is most inclusive, positive, optimistic and friendly movement you could imagine.  As a gay person the only place I have found anger and rejection is from the Left.  To the <1% who are actual racists/sexists/homophobes/bigots, you are not welcome here.  Everyone else is!
People need to learn diversity isn't just race or gender or sexuality. What happened to diversity of thought?

While I appreciate the intention of this post, equality is a myth.  Identity politics for all or identity politics for none. Those who pick & choose which races can and can't are the true racists.
And we're done with power/privilege + bigotry = racism. Treating others in a manner based off of their race is racism. Everyone should be treated well without regard to race.
[removed]
We are literally the only people that punch right. Idc who you are if you're on our side. You will never see a leftist denounce communism or terrorists.
America is hurting for a common culture of some sort that isn't just "celebrating OTHER cultures". Something we had got lost and I'm not sure how to bring it back with so many well meaning but ignorant people arguing that everything is white nationalism or cultural appropriation or something.
Fuck white enthonationalists? ok. lets look at what ethnonationalism is; "The central theme of ethnic nationalists is that nations are defined by a shared heritage, which usually includes a common language, a common faith, and a common ethnic ancestry."  Is that not exactly what Israel, Japan, or China are? Nothing is wrong about preserving your heritage from constant immigration from countries that do not share your values. immigrants that out breed the native population.
Yep!  This is always the best place to point someone who thinks Trump supporter = racist.  No racism:  It's right in the fucking rules.
I gotta say I have never in my life seen so many democrats come to defend a person quicker then when that person is/was in the KKK and a real racist. Thanks Robert Byrd for showing us the real racist and makin em wear a big ol' D
What is wrong with white people advocating for their own interests as a group? That is what literally every other group does shamelessly. That is what political correctness attempts to stop. All political correctness is is an attempt by the left to remove the vocabulary necessary for whites to advocate for their own interests.  This post is pro-PC horse shit, and probably a leftist troll.
If you're bashing someone SOLELY based on the color of their skin, then yes, FUCK RACISTS. It's just nonsensical hate. HOWEVER, if you're bashing shitty ideologies or a shitty specific trait that pertains to a specific skin color, then that is not racism, and it has nothing to do with the skin color of said community.

Cringey. Stop fucking caring about who is and who isn't racist. They're going to call you racist anyway.   It doesn't matter if you criticize affirmative action or actually start loading fucking jews into camps: you will be called the exact same word. Stop pretending like the word "racism" matters.  Japan, Korea, and most of Africa is comprised of explicit ethnostates. The idea of ethnostatism isn't unique and it's not wrong. Please for the love of god stop giving the left power by ceding them moral authority.
Why is white ethnonationalist in quotation marks? Is this attacking white racists and supremacists?  Is this sub against the idea that perhaps the endemic ethnic groups of europe have a right to demographic security as is the case around the rest of the world?

Western Civilization was built by white men, anyone seeking to destroy white people though diversity, multi-culturalism  or other forms of cultural conquest is a traitor to Western Civilization and should be drawn and quartered.  Other races are welcome to benefit from the umbrella of technological progress and advancement provided by Western Civilization, so long as they do not seek to undermine it through violence, subversive ideology, degeneracy or Islamic invasion. 
Er, how is being a white ethnonationalist racist? Isn't that someone who thinks that all the races should have self determination, but avoid multiculturalism and diversity due to historical and philosophical evidence that "diversity" always leads to conflict, civil unrest, and the eventually downfall of the nation? Or something like that, idk. 
"**White** Ethnonationalists?"  So I guess only white people are wrong to want to be a majority in their own country? Its totally fine if blacks, asians or brown people are majority in thier but FUCK white people amirite?  Fuck you OP. These "white ethnonationalists" you speak of simply don't want the government to mass import people from countries with different culture, you're treating them as if they're promoting genocide.  I don't know which retard mod stickied this post, it reeks of Berniebot concern trolling.
This buys into the CNN narrative that ethnonationalism is necessarily racist. It's not--it just acknowledges that race is real, and that humans are designed to live in homogeneous populations. Diversity is a failed social model that forces conflict on us. White nationalists, black nationalists, etc are fully capable of cooperating and being allies with people across racial boundaries.   I don't think we should put feels before reality on this sub just to make it marketable to emotional idiots.
The Admins are suffering from low energy - have resorted to editing YOUR posts. Sad!
And guess what Centipedes... THERE IS MORE! The admins quite literally, hours before this, sent the mod team a note saying they appreciate how professional we are! Pathetic! Unprofessional!
This is a HUGE deal. Like, way more than some people even realize.    Think about this. Here's a hypothetical example of what the admins could potentially do with this:    - Admins don't like a particular subreddit? All they have to do is forge a top comment to contain doxxing or something and use that as pretext to shut the whole sub down.    - Admins don't like a particular user? Forge one of their comments to tell a user to kill themselves, giving them pretext to ban them.    - Admins want to control the narrative about something? Just ban a top comment user, edit their post to say something that benefits their narrative and maybe even forge some Reddit Gold onto the post to make it look like people support the agenda.     tl;dr: Reddit is fucked. Trust nothing.
#**HAVE YOU EVER BEEN SO TRIGGERED THAT YOU STARTED ANONYMOUSLY EDITING USER POSTS ON YOUR WEBSITE?**
This, unfortunately, calls into question the validity of any post made on the entirety of reddit, and raises sincere concerns, beyond The_Donald. (Fake)News outlets often cite reddit posts, which are now revealed to be entirely falsifiable by the admins, with no trace. This is a dark day for Reddit.
Wow, so they can literally just edit someone's post and make it say whatever they want? That's scary. Full-on Orwellian. Makes me wonder if maybe they posted the alleged doxxing themselves just to have an excuse to shut down r/pizzagate.

Spez, I'm a mother. One of the things that a competent mother does, is teach their children  (1) to know the difference between right and wrong, and  (2) to do what is right, not what is wrong.  This is usually accomplished at a very early age.   You have repeatedly shown publicly that either you think you don't have to do what is right, or that you can't recognize the difference between right and wrong. My suggestion is to step down from Reddit, and take up some other occupation in which doing the right thing is easier for you to recognize and stick to.

So the admins, during a time we are getting traffic from theguardian the failing New York Times and Vice changed posts critical of the administration of the site to appear as if they are not being criticized. When a shareholder might visit the site to see what they are paying for- reddit admins don't want to see a fuck you too the admins. Pissing your userbase off to the point that they would risk a permanent ban to directly attack you is bad for business. So, the business practice here is to defraud a diligent shareholder by replacing dissent toward the people who run the site- with dissent toward other users. I doubt  Condé Nast Publications would want to see how the admins are playing games to deflect criticism- in an underhanded manner.  Please don't use your admin powers to edit me- (spez callout here -->) /u/spez.

Pelosi shouldn't even be using military assets to fly abroad, period.  Let alone to multiple foreign countries like Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.  She is in the house of representatives. She's supposed to be representing Americans in her state, in America. There is zero reason for her to travel abroad on America's dime.   I love that Trump did this. And flying commercial with her entourage won't be soo easy.  With a military jet, all she has to do is say where she wants to go and they do the rest. With a commercial jet, she has to deal with all of the planning and logistics and wait times, even if she's paying someone else to plan all of that, if there's a delay somewhere in the trip, the whole trips schedule could change and become a headache to deal with.  She also won't have the priority/protection that comes with military assets. 
OMFG   I wish there was a camera in Nancy's face when she saw this
This begs the question, why are members of Congress allowed to travel internationally on the tax payers dime? McNoName did this and that’s how we got ISIS.

Weren't reddit faggots gloating about how Pelosi showed Trump who's in charge just a few days ago?
Now THAT is a burn of the highest quality.
We’re not worthy of this gentleman!!!
GEOTUS is a MASTER of 5th generation letter-warfare. She doesn't know what she started!
CNN on Pelosi: she made a “power move” with the suggestion to postpone the speech.   CNN on Trump: what an absolute disgrace of a man to make this kind of move.
Just saw a news report saying most of congress isn’t even in DC so nothing can get done, “Some are taking long weekends”, it’s Thursday. They are getting paid to take vacations to Hawaii, while the government is shutdown and regular hard working Americans are not getting paid. Meanwhile Trump has been in DC the whole time waiting to make a deal, and the Democrats and misleadia are saying it’s trumps fault. How is it trumps fault if Congress is vacationing? Peoples angers are completely in the wrong place. 
Why is an American representative of a congressional district doing public relations trips with foreign nations?  Gotta pucker up for those campaign donations. 
This is hilarious. 😂   All humor aside, the fact that the government is shutdown and these clowns were on their way to a week long "Public Relations" event is absolutely appalling. President Trump did the right thing.. Pelosi needs to be in Washington negotiating, not gallivanting around the globe.

The funniest part about it is that absolutely nobody can possibly come to their defense. Even if they stick to their BS arguments against our President, they've undercut their own defense.

This is United States Women's Chess Champion Nazi Paikidze. The World Women's Chess Championship just started in Iran, but she won't be attending because she'd have to wear a Hijab; she doesn't believe in the oppression of women. Let's show her our support!

They don't want strong women improving their 3D chess game.
"This is a post for those who don't understand why I am boycotting FIDE's decision. I think it's unacceptable to host a WOMEN'S World Championship in a place where women do not have basic fundamental rights and are treated as second-class citizens. For those saying that I don't know anything about Iran: I have received the most support and gratitude from the people of Iran, who are facing this situation every day. Thank you"
We have the best nazis don't we folks?
Would be funny if she attended but wore a [transparent hijab](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pgarbYfIqn0/Td_f36_vmpI/AAAAAAAAAMI/C4A9SBDUA3U/s400/rainbonnet.png).
This woman is an actual feminist. She's also very smart and beautiful. She deserves much respect for her attitude.  Also, to crush your secret hopes, she's married.
You won't see this on twoxchromosomes 
True feminism!!! Nazi Paikidze and Marine Le Pen did the same thing. Both were forced to use the hijab, and both refused. I applaud them.   Definitely beats the yelling feminazi land whale: "look at my pussy hat. real women don't shave armpits. bring in muslims they obviously can't be as bad as white privilaged males. bernie can still win"
Didn't we do this already?
I did nazi that coming!
Blond hair.  Attractive.  *Dirty White devil*.   Named Nazi?   She should probably be jailed TBH she would oppress the poor Iranians.
**Why aren't Feminists aren't all over this?**  A woman seeking to empower herself and send a message of equality and women's rights being DENIED a championship that she'd likely win because she refuses to cover herself up.  Where's the collective Leftist outrage and why am I more bothered by this than they are?
Brava!  She is an intelligent, beautiful young woman standing up for truly  oppressed women.    "Liberals" EAT YOUR HEART OUT!
People that don't agree with her, can you explain why they they would never not wear their hijab' if they came here but we have to when we go there? I'll tell you.  It's called dominance. Their way or no way. That's fair to you? And before you pick this apart just think of the actual point I'm trying to make. It goes beyond their attire. 
CNN headline: "r/the Donald supports Nazi" coming in 3...2...
She has my support! Freedom for all women! 
CNN Headline: Trump supporters praise Nazi!
Reminds me of a book 📚 I read several years ago about Iran's political transition to Islamic Fundamentalism.   It's called "Reading Lolita in Iran."   Laws preventing women from attending school, holding jobs, being seen in public are enacted. Women meet in secret and read classic literature including "Lolita." Analyses of the books are entertwined with current events.  It's a good read. 
It's already over
REPOSTS
Why the fuck should she have to wear a hijab? Bullshit. We don't tell YOUR women to take off their hijab in our country, you shouldn't be able to tell us we have to wear in yours. Fuck you, Iran.    Wanted to add a point: If Iran wants the opportunity to host an event such as this, they should realize that not everyone will dress like them. They are being stubborn, rude, and classless by making women from other countries obey their dress code. It's a WORLD WIDE competition. Not a Iran one. So you want to host world events? Get over yourself and allow people to actually participate. 
Liberal media be like "/r/The_Donald supports Nazi."
How intolerant of her to not submit to covering her head like a second class citizen!  /s
As a liberal, I can say I totally support this.
So, just to clarify. Someone thought it would be a great idea to name this girl "nazi"? 
Wtf are you talking about she is literally a Nazi 
she is literally a nazi
Who's dumb idea was it to hold the women's chess tourney in a nation that most agree is a hostile environment for women?
This girl is awesome. Check out her social media, so based and intelligent. Damn. 
The championship ended two weeks ago.  OP is a dumbass karma whore.
Literally a Nazi.
I don't understand why the sexes don't cross over in things like this?  chess, pool, even some Olympic sports...  If there isn't anything physically demanding enough to separate the 2... why don't they compete on the same field?

Remember, it's RACIST to not follow the customs of a society that considers women to be property

This is why that famous image the left is using of the muslim girl in the hijab (something that symbolizes female oppression) made out of the American flag (something that symbolizes freedom) triggers me.  They really have no idea how foolish they look.

As an Indian, i felt proud when our sharpshooter [Heena Sidhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heena_Sidhu) who was world#1 in April'2014 decided to boycott the Asian air weapon competition in iran over compulsory Hijab law. This is what she had to say :-  > Im not a revolutionary. But I feel dat making it mandatory for even a sportsperson to wear hijab is not in the spirit of a Sport.   Source: https://www.rt.com/sport/364868-shooter-boycotts-iran-tournament-hijab/  Its great to see more and more sports women coming out openly against this regressive law. More power to her.
It's not a world chess championship, if the best aren't playing.   That tournament is a joke.
Dickless mentally retarded liberals would rather support the religion that says women must have their clitoris cut off and their bodies covered and shamed for fear of being raped and murdered than support a real woman who takes a stand against a caveman-level ideology.

As someone who lives in Columbus I can tell you Somali refugees in Columbus are a huge problem. Columbus has the highest amount in the country per capta.   The problem isn't all but the radical one. Here's a few examples of problems they have caused before today in Columbus. 1. They still practice female circumcisions. They do this to their daughters between the age of 13-16 in their homes. Once they have done this they call an ambulance to save their daughters lives. This has caused the hospitals and suburbs of Columbus millions of dollars for training to save these poor girls. 2. In some school districts they have demanded their kids are taught by only male teachers. The district had to go out and pay extra money to hire a male Muslim teacher to come in on Saturdays to educate their kids.  3. The neighborhoods they have moved into have high crime rates. (There are other neighborhoods within in a mile that don't have these same problems.

As a Michigan fan...I'm glad you're safe and commend our boys in blue for stopping the TERRORIST threat. Hopefully everyone comes out of it OK. God Bless you Buckeyes, geez never thought I'd say that lol
Somalians are like the Muslims of the Muslim world
**WE HAVE THE BEST FIRST RESPONDERS, FOLKS!**
Damn 1 minute.  Very impressive.  Saved lives for sure.
[The heroic cop who ended the attack](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CyYNdrhXUAAxWQE.jpg)
Get ready boys. Leftist cucks will start to make Trump look like the culprit (TRUMPS VICTORY OFFENDED THE OPPRESSED SOMALI REFUGEE, HE WAS JUST EXPRESSING HIMSELF). The SJWs will make the cop look like a villain for shooting him and try to make it sound like he could handle the situation without killing him.
I wish I had police officers like that!
Somali Terrorist: 0 Good Guys: 1
Gotta give sum love to this MAGA marksman! Very bad situation for the students involved, very good for President Trump's previous statements concerning Islamic Terrorism. He's always right, and he's about to win a second election produced by traitorous Ltards who "CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!"

Funny how when this was ongoing, there were like 6 threads about it on the top of /r/all.   Annnnnnd, it was a Muslim.   Silence. Everywhere.   Except here. We have the best dom, don't we folks? 
Following in the footsteps of Texan security, good on them. 
Glad to hear that you are safe first and foremost. Serious props to such a good response time from the first responders.
PLEASE REMOVE THE BRACKETS ITS SOMALI REFUGEE TERRORIST!
So you're telling me he was a Muslim?
Lefties downvoting the stopping of terrorist attacks. Smh
Who can be so fucking disgraceful to downvote this?  For real, it's praising the effectiveness of the security forces. Disgustin. This should have a 99% like ratio. I don't care If you don't like Trump nor this subreddit but that hate shouldn't contaminate your point of view over the security forces.
Great job by the campus Police and OSU alert, right on. 
YES YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN! LET US KNOW IF ANY OF THOSE PATRIOTS NEED A COAT!
Out out out!!!! Why are taking immigrants known for pirates and terorists-- PRESIDENT TRUMP.... SAVIOR OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION 
9 people in the hospital in less than a minute. Time to ban cars and knives. Let's start a national knife registry at Williams Sonoma.
how did 35% of people downvote this? the fuck is wrong with people?!
Glad you made it out safe and happy to hear a report from a Centipede there in person.  
BLUE LIVES MATTER  BASED POLICE, PROTECTORS OF THE PEACE
Big thanks to those brave men and women.
HEROES
Finally something i can really agree with you guys about! That was great work from that officer.
Glad that useless, selfish, worthless fuck was shot dead before he tried to murder anyone else.   The fact he was a Somali Refugee makes it worse because the MSM will be defending him. If he was a white conservative, they'd demonize the shit out of him non stop for the next 2 weeks.  **Thank God for our brave Police**
>eliminated the Somali refugee (terrorist) within ONE MINUTE of the attack.  #Under budget and ahead of schedule 
omg.... thank you to those guys!!! Somali refugee?? so it was a mulim terror attack?
One of the few subreddits left that stands for it's bastion of free speech, THANK YOU. So tired of seeing worldnews and politics on the front page with their ctr shill commenters and the circle jerk which comes with it. Sorry for the rant but I just can't stand the bias and hypocrisy 
[deleted]
Can someone direct me to where in the news it was mentioned this was a Somali refugee? The news articles I've found so far only state that no information has been released yet about the attacker.  The University Police deserve commendation for their quick and decisive action in this attack.
Should have pulled a Bernie and handed them their guns and equipment and stood there silently.
It will only get more efficient under Trump. MAGA! 
**HELL FUCKING YES.**
Let you smoke weed on the porch of your trap house, partake in keg stands, merc terrorists in the blink of an eye. OSU cops are undoubtedly based. 
 .... aaaand he's a young male Muslim!
Contrast that to the 2013 attack in London (big gun "safe space") on a soldier in broad daylight where it took armed officers 14 minutes to arrive on the scene.  Great response time and glad that nothing worse occurred!
Ohio was always a MAGA state no matter how hard that cuck Kasich tried to hold it back.
amen to that!  if this happened at Berkeley there'd be a pile of corpses and the cops would still be trying to get the killer to express his feelings!
A good guy with a gun could prevent a terrorist from harming more people? Who would've known.
Of course Reddit would downvote the hell out of this.
[deleted]
As a democratic socialist who hates everything this sub stands for: FUCKING.  THIS.  Very very impressed by OSU police and emergency responders.  Somebody I know was injured in the attack and I worry about what might have happened had the response not been as quick as it was.
One minute. Fucking Bravo!

Posts about the attackers race and religion are being censored in /r/news. I even commented on one that stated he was muslim, went back minutes later and it was deleted along with several other comments like it
I'm really saddened that stuff like this will probably start happening in my country thanks to Merkel & Co - and the worst thing is that we don't have guns to defend ourselves with here.

Refugee terrorists are the worst. How do we tell the difference between a refugee terrorist and a regular refugee again?  Props to the officers that ended it quickly.
The craziest part is that this isn't even the first Somalian to go crazy and hack people up with a knife in Columbus this year! A family friend of a friend owns a restaurant in town called the Cafe Nazareth. Apparently this offended  a Somalian man so much he went inside and asked for the owner, then started slashing people with a machete. 2 Somalian knife terror attacks in the same city in one year. What are the fucking odds?

Trump's official pro-DOMA stance. END THE LIES
It's almost like he plans to be president for all Americans or something.
Genuine question, please don't ban me, although I'm expecting the downvotes. How does this coincide with his list of ~20 potential Supreme Court nominations, all of whom have vowed to repeal the same sex marriage act? I've been curious about this since originally viewing him holding the flag. Thank you very much
Trump is the most socially progressive Republican in history.  He said he doesn't care which bathroom a person uses, including inside Trump Tower, and he got a lot of flak from Cruz for that. Trump won, not Cruz.  He had Peter Thiel speak directly before him at the convention, where Thiel stated "I am proud to be gay, I am proud to be Republican, and I am proud to be an American" to which he got a standing ovation.  Trump then said he would protect the LGBTQ community in his own speech afterwards, and got the crowd to applaud him for saying that, then said "You know I have to say, as a Republican, I'm happy to have you applaud for that" to which he got even more applause.  Here's a great interview from the Advocate magazine which shows Trump's social progressivsm: http://www.advocate.com/election/2015/9/28/read-donald-trumps-advocate-interview-where-he-defends-gays-mexicans  With all that said, Trump never said this quote, and this meme is fake. Sorry.

I keep seeing Liberals posting this RNC speech and the NC Bathroom quote acting like he played his supporters as if these are new developments we didn't know about. Not smart people folks!
Donald Trump's policy on what you do in the bedroom with a willing adult partner:  > "I don't give a fuck, why are you asking me this question when China is screwing us on trade!!!"
One of my favorite things about Trump is that I think he's single-handedly moving the Republican party to the center on social issues.  He's always been for equal rights, he's been outspokenly in support of the LGBT community, and he's down with legal weed (he wants medical legal everywhere and recreational left to the states).

We cherish our gays
Narrative BTFO.
Hi there, libtard here. I don't think that you're racists, I don't think that you're bigots, but I *would* like to explain the reason that we're worried about this so that hopefully we can foster understanding and maybe someone here can prove that this won't be an issue. I would welcome some reassurance.  Here is part of an interview with Trump during the primaries, when he was still struggling to convince the Christian right that they should rally behind him:  > **WALLACE:** But, Mr. Trump, let's take one issue.  You say now that the Supreme Court has ruled that same-sex marriage is the law of the land and that any politician who talks about wanting to amend the Constitution is just playing politics.  Are you saying it's time to move on?  > **TRUMP**: No, I'm saying this.  It has been ruled up.  It has been there.  If I'm a, you know, if I'm elected, I would be very strong on putting certain judges on the bench that I think maybe could change things.  > But they've got a long way to go.  I mean at some point, we have to get back down to business.  But there's no question about it.  I mean most — and most people feel this way.  > They have ruled on it.  I wish that it was done by the state.  I don't like the way they ruled.  I disagree with the Supreme Court from the standpoint they should have given the state — it should be a states' rights issue.  And that's the way it should have been ruled on, Chris, not the way they did it.  > This is a very surprising ruling.  And I — I can see changes coming down the line, frankly.  But I would have much preferred that they ruled at a state level and allowed the states to make those rulings themselves.  > **WALLACE**: But — but just to button this up very quickly, sir, are you saying that if you become president, you might try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage?  > **TRUMP**: I would strongly consider that, yes.  This is the basis of the fear regarding gay marriage. He didn't outright say that he planned on attempting to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, and it sounded like he was waffling at first to try not to make any commitments, but he *did* claim that he would strongly consider it when pressed on the issue.  That's why we're worried. If anyone has any light to shed on the issue, I'd much appreciate it. Congratulations on the win y'all, and best of luck with the next four years. Sincerely.  Edit: Thanks for all of the responses, folks. I appreciate your willingness to talk it out with me.

My gay coworker today told me that he thinks Trump will round up all the gays and put them in camps.   What the fuck is wrong with people? Seriously. 
i got banned from r/lgbt/ for posting a similar picture.
BASED PRESIDENT ELECT  I'm not gonna lie, Obamas cabinet did help advance LGBT rights in the public and private sphere. So, for that, I salute them.  Pretty much everything else was a disaster. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was actually clutch.   I'm hopeful that this period will get some dems and my LGBT brothers and sisters to embrace the 2nd amendment.   That being said, I'm really pleased that Trump won.  #LGBTrump  Guns are not a left or right issue. It's sad that it has become a political issue over defending yourself. 
but but i thought he was going to kill all the fags...i know as a white nationalist literal rapist fucking male, that was my number one issue for voting on him....not jobs, or the wall, or seeing shitlibs cry, or keeping that satan worshipping bitch out of the white house....no no no, i wanted all the fags dead....fuuuuuuck...
When did he say this? It's not in his RNC speech transcript
#GO GAYS! 
MAKE GAYS FABULOUS AGAIN!!!
Didn't he say that he opposes same sex marriage though?  Just asking, I think I read something along these lines.
He's almost a libertarian, like do whatever the fuck you want on your own time, I'm busy fighting ISIS and China's trade deals.  Me likey.
All of my straight friends are flipping out on my behalf and I'm just sitting here like I JUST WANT TO MAGA
Armed and gay   #hesmypresident
"Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBT community. As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology." -- Trump at the RNC
[deleted]
It's weird being a gay person who voted for Trump. Even weirder seeing people claim Trump will make same sex marriage illegal. Even if he wanted to, there's no way he'd survive the public backlash and he knows it. I didn't vote for Hillary because she's publicly been against marriage equality before then switched and acts like she's always been pro marriage equality. If she can "evolve" like that it's not impossible to assume she might flip again. Plus the fact that she subverted the will of the people during the primaries makes me worried what she would do if she were President. To think she'd suddenly become moral when she entered the Oval Office is foolish. Not to mention her foundation receiving millions from Saudi Arabia where I would be stoned to death for being who I am. On principle I can never support someone like that.   Trump isn't a perfect candidate, I don't think such a thing exists. Ultimately this country won't get better by relying on anyone else to do what's best. You have to be the positive change you want to see.   It's sad to see so many people lose their cool and resort to attacking each other. Those of us who are American citizens need to keep that in mind, whatever happens we are all in this together. I can only hope cooler heads will prevail in the coming months.   
But but but but my narrative.
I still don't understand how he's in ANY way homophobic when he's been in favor of gay people serving openly in the military, and getting married since at least 2000, yet Hillary is STILL against gay marriage 
Man, I'm not extremely into politics but I knew this man was good. Screw what /r/politics are saying. I'll show off my Trump sign with pride. 
TBH Trump really doesn't care about social issues. He doesn't care what people do,  but he had to have it in his platform. He has way bigger things to worry about then what bathroom people can use 
DOMA was the law bill Clinton signed that defined federally that marriage was between one man and one woman.... So title should be his ANTI-DOMA stance
During the primary, Trump was attacked for his progressive views but he was the adrenaline shot of modernity the GOP needed.  Then the corrupt Clinton Machine did everything in their power to assassinate the character of Donald J. Trump.  Once the dust settles, all of America will see that Donald J Trump is the president this nation needed when it needed him the most.
What? He wasn`t going to send them to concentration camp? ARE YOU KIDDING ME???
But he's holding the flag upside down so these crybabies still hate him. I'm not even joking either, it's pathetic. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkV9dXF3VR0  "And I have to say, as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said."
President Trump's support of the LGBT community has been amazing.  Accepting the reality that individual liberty can co-exist with religious liberty is the direction the party needs to go. 
But my favorite celebrity says Trump is bad... sooo im gonna go sign a petition. #democratsdontacceptdemocracy
How is it that as soon as he's elected, I hear all the nice stuff about him, but before that there was only horrible things said. O.O   I'm starting to like Trump!
Libtards:  "It's upside down so it's fake and doesn't count, #NotMyRainbow"
I just don't understand why libs think he is a homophobe. Has he ever said anything controversial about gays? Did I miss something?
is there a clip of him saying this? I looked up the RNC bit about gays and all he said was in response to the Orlando attack, that he would protect them from terrorist attacks and 'foreign ideology', nothing about rights.

"DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO PUT GAYS BACK IN CHAINS!" -shut up uncle Joe you're drunk.

#BUT CNN SAID HE WAS A BAD GUY
Why is the government even involved in marriage at all? Marriage should be a personal thing and the government should not be involved. Any financial agreements or legal agreements should be made in the form of an LLC or similar legal agreement between the two parties. 
I've been saying this since the night he got elected.   My FB feed was filled with outrage naturally. And while I don't agree with all of his positions, one thing I knew I could trust him on was social issues. The man is the most progressive Republican in history. I wish my liberal friends could put aside their salt for one minute and research it for themselves.  I lean left no doubt, but I hope President Trump will steer us right. He won fair and square, and I support him 100%
Instead of fighting for the right to marry, perhaps we should be asking why we need a license to get married in the first place? #abolishmarriagelicenses
And just to remind everyone, both Obama and Biden repeatedly said marriage was only for heterosexual couples in 2008.  The entire Democrat Party said the same thing.  So I guess Democrats were totally homophobic and wanted to stone gay people until 2012 when Obama flipped his position because gay donors were upset.
Can we just agree that the world shouldn't revolve around gay people and our acceptance of them?   Liberals are acting like his sole purpose for running was so he could be stay in the public eye and make homophobic and sexist remarks. Wake the fuck up, get a job, and realize that this election was about a hell of a lot more than LGBT rights. I hope this post making it to #1 /all will calm a few people down.
Will he appoint a judge that will overturn SCOTUS decision?
[deleted]
I just don't get how we can make this clearer. Why is the news ignoring this? Don't they know that people are getting hurt out there by brainwashed panicking libtards?
Do you have a source for this?   (former Dem trying to find out more about the new prez here)
I realized this morning that it was likely Rosie who caused this misconception.  Who could honestly believe that a New Yorker Billionaire was homophobic?  Their open minds are what allows them to read people and negotiate deals. 
So gays are freaking out about Trump even though Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law banning gay marriage.  Just admit this is all about partisan politics and not your sexuality.  
If people knew Trump he said "We need to take care of our Hispanics" and "We need to work with our Muslim communities". Not to mention that he spent months with middle class black people.   Everything about him being a bigot and a homophobic person would be debunked if people just listened to him. The left has always had an agenda though. TRUMP IS FREE FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS.
Honestly who the fucks about gay marriage its just a tax break, let them have it
Why can't people get this into their brains? And if you show people this, oftentimes they don't believe you.
I love how the DNC tried to slander him as a bigot and a hate mongerer who will reverse the clock 30 years.   Equal rights for everyone, regardless of sexual orientation? yes.   Legal cannabis? Will leave it to the state and respect their decision  Healthcare? Make it more affordable for everyone  Education? Lower college debt and bring back trade schools  Trade? NAFTA and the TPP need to get reworked to benefit the USA  Global Warming? Take that money and allow open competition in a free market to give clean energy a fair chance. (Clean energy is going to see a huge boost under Trump because competition is the best thing for a free market. oil/coal/gas will now have to compete with solar/nuclear/wind even more if they want to hold the profit margins.)   Terrorism? We are going to make Guantanamo Bay great again. The one thing I agree with 110%, that's without a doubt. I agree with this because these people who commit these crimes have no respect for the Geneva Convention. They will literally throw a gay person from the roof to kill them. These people decapitate victims with a butterknife on live TV because they are doing the work of Allah and it is justified. Waterboarding and force feeding up the ass is not punishment enough for people who fight against US the free world.   Immigration? Let's build a wall and let people who want to actually work get an easier path towards citizenship. HOLY FUCKING SHIT! If you want to be an American you can become one if you uphold the ideals of our nation. That doesn't seem like a ridiculous claim. Also, if you are an illegal and committed a violent crime, or a drug trafficking crime you can GTFO immediately. Otherwise, get the fuck to the back of the line.   Illegal drugs? BUILD THE WALL, my state of NH has been over run with heroin. We have more OD's and people dying  because of this than any other state in the union. It is disgusting and must end.   Law and order? We need to restore faith in the relations between the community and police. We are all going to work together.     I also like that this is the same stance that Maggie Hassan, democrat elect of NH for the US Senate has on these same issues. She also beat Kelly Ayotte who fucking betrayed us like a weak willed turncoat. Granted Hassan has different views on tax code, they are very similar in opinion about drugs and building the wall. I voted for Hassan and Trump because I want to make NH great again! I WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I'm not a fervent Trump supporter, but this is really great to know. I am glad he openly supported them. I really do believe he will make sure to fight for them.  However, I think it's understandable that some people are concerned about the VP-Elect's stance on LGBTQ issues/rights. 
This is the beginning of a new Republican party.   Let's get the party started!

Oh ffs I have to upvote something on /r/The_Donald  What the fuck has the world come to  
WOW WHAT A HOMOPHOBE /s
I got no problem with homosexual unions/marriage, but when berate/punish others for not jumping gung-ho on your bandwagon, (the bake me a cake/cater my wedding thugs) piss off.
Where are people getting the idea that he doesn't support gay marriage?
People that have known Donald Trump well and for years point out that a) he is not homophobic  b) he employs a lot of women in top positions (not a misogynist) c) he accepts advice, listens to people then decides on the best course of action (not impulsive)  In fact, the narrative put forward by HRC supporters isn't supported at all by the facts.  
When do I get paid! I've been drawing HRC supporters to the light with this for over a week
And he's not famous for listening or following his party platform
Love Trumps Hate, folks. Love Trumps Hate.  Hee hee hee, I  still can't quit giggling over 11/9
The SJW's can't see this...they're busy destroying their own cities. 
Asexual black woman who uses Tumblr here, coming in peace, just wanted to say: the 'Liberal Freakout' about Anti-LGBT isn't about Trump, its about [PENCE](https://www.google.com/search?q=mike+pence+video+gays&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#q=mike+pence+gays).  We're not scared about Trump's presidency -- we're terrified of the people who followed the more extreme of his words to the letter and intend to do us harm (IE, not Trump Voters, White Supremacists,) and the fact that, through Trump, Mike Pence officially got his foot in the door. Please, please don't drop out Trump. Please do a decent job and don't let Mike Pence whisper sweet, sinister nothings into your ear. I don't care if all you do for the next four years is turn the White House into a fucking Playboy Mansion, do not drop out and give this shit to Pence.  Mike Pence wanted to divert funds away from HIV testing and into conversion therapy. [With all due respect, I'm a little perturbed due to the extent of torture some of these young men and women are subjected to. I don't even want to begin going down that rabbit hole so, feel free to google it yourself and draw your own conclusions.](https://www.google.com/search?q=conversion+therapy&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8) Keep in mind, no matter your feelings on HIV, this hurts all of us - Gay, straight, whatever, HIV doesn't pick a side.   And its not just anti-gay, [he doesn't believe in evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikax0Y0NJsY). Warning: Man who clearly does not know what science or [the scientific definition of a 'Theory' is.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory)  Please keep in mind that, like Trump supporters and the groups some of us are fearing over here, I do not represent all of Tumblr. So others might feel differently, but I personally only fear having Trump step down and give Pence ultimate control, which terrifies me. 
I voted for Clinton this Tuesday, and still believe she would have been better for the country.  Even so, I found this post extremely reassuring.  We all want what's best for the nation, and I hope from the bottom of my heart that Donald will be a great president for all Americans.
Man I'll suck ya dick a little bit
How dare he!? He wants to make America better for LGBT's?
Just dont let Pence take the wheel. 
Is there some good evidence for this? A link to him saying this on audio? A youtube video, perhaps? This picture isn't exactly safe to use as a citation but I would be extremely interested to see if this has some kind of validity to it. 
But but I thought he was a literally Hitler anti LGBT evil racist! 
As a non trump voter ive never been given any reason to think otherwise.
Is there a video of this?
 Hey /u/dartbeard,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
People wont shut up about how it's upside-down, as if that's done on purpose to show that he's secretly planning on banning gay people or something ridiculous. 
It's almost like he's not actually a racist bigot, that he was saying those things to get people to pay attention to him, that he really does care for all Americans!
That's great! Listen, you need to understand that people fear his appointments. Maybe he won't do it on purpose, but his appointees have a very real possibility of using Trump to push a shady agenda. This includes alienating the rights of LGBT persons, among others. Reasonable people do at least, have legit concerns about how in the coming years, his polices will serve to damage the liberty of the country. You'll have your guns, but the rights of others are going to be damaged by the end of his presidency.   I am confident that I will be banned or my posts deleted from lots of these subreddits soon, so I wont be able to have a discussion with any of you (I hope I'm wrong about that).   If you've made it this far into the comment without shutting off, let me impart some words to you: this man is not your friend. He's betraying us. He uses people and that is all of you. 
Can we make this a thing where Trumplicans are pro-gay rights, pro-legal marijuana, and at the same time keeping with his economic policies?  Want to scare the shit out of Democrats? Because that is how you scare the shit out of Democrats.  A party where economic policy is top dog and a live and let live social platform is king. Talk about a further uniting God Emperor.
Great meme but that wasn't RNC. His RNC speech by itself and his rally where he heals up the flag are just as beautiful. No need to discredit validity. Love you fam
Alright. You got me, cool. Please uphold this promise through your future rhetoric and actions. Thx

Don't do that. Sounds like the share fishing people do on facebook about cancer patients and shit.
Dear Kek, Who art in heaven Hallowed be Thy Name; Thy kekdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in kekdom. Give us this day our daily memes, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who brigade against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from CUCKS. Amen.

Fuck YouTube. YouTube is deleting and censoring all videos that show ANTIFA committing violence
Wonder what their excuse is now...
[deleted]
It's important we back up these videos as soon as they are published.  So if we lose them from youtube, we can re-upload them elsewhere.  This mass censorship must be fought, especially with regard to facebook and google (youtube).   
***1984 was supposed to be a warning not a How-to guide.***
[deleted]
A lot of people were promoting vid.me a while back. The problem was that people were not leaving CuckTube for vid.me because of their monetization. Hopefully, people will now switch in droves since their monetization is being taken from them involuntarily. 
Bitchute peer to peer video service go go go!
#ANTITRUST NOW
Looks like we need our own video site then.
Pretty sure they've removed my access for flagging Alt-Left propaganda channels such as the tyt as well. 
Record everything you find, including the censorship. Deleting the videos is destruction of evidence. They are complicit actors in an insurrection and should be treated as such.
Pathetic.
Check out BitChute(I'm not affiliated). Torrent powered video site that began last year as a reaction to the demonetization of youtube videos because they saw what was coming.  https://www.bitchute.com/
Is dailymotion a good youtube alternative?
They will not destroy us. Flood Live Leak!
Would this get down voted on redacted?
VidMe?
Bitchute is gaining traction lately, might be a good alternative.
Archive everything, upload it to Bitchute and Vidme. Hell, upload it to pornhub. Having something only on YouTube won't work anymore.
There are videos of ANTIFA destroying shit and assaulting people that go back a decade. I wonder if YouTube pulled those too.
[deleted]
We need some kind of list for these as well.  Kind of like the violence against Trump supporters one- but just with clips of ANTIFA in action 
Do we have any place where we are keeping track of deleted videos, demonetization and any other censorship? Seems like we should be tracking this kind of stuff. Like an official T_D wiki or something.
This thread was removed from /all. 17k upvotes in 5 hours and it isn't number 1? Give me a break.

Has anyone checked out dtube.com? It’s on the block chain network. It’s decentralized so we shouldn’t have the same problem as Youtube.   Spez: it’s actually dtube.video my bad
**Save them locally**  ---------    You can find several options by using duckduckgo or bing (works pretty well now) just use your best judgement.   This way you can always re-upload them to less cucked sources.
I just wish companies like YouTube, Twitter, Google, and Facebook, that have grown to be more than just a company but a monopoly of sorts of social communication in the Information Age, would take that responsibility more seriously.  Let people say what they want and the chips fall where they may. People can block content and users individually. It doesn't need to be done on an administrative level and political views should not be censored no matter what they are or how much we disagree with them. These sites were once a bastion of free speech and one of the greatest democratic principles our country stands on. The stream of opinion and information had created democratic movements in the world more effectively than any US bullets and more powerful than the oppressive regimes trying to shut them down.  Now they have become censors and are going against all that made them great to begin with and it's sad with the potential for greatness these places have. They were once the greatest weapons in the free world's arsenal, now they may very well become its greatest obstacle.
youtube/goolag is Antifa
#Migrate to [bitchute](https://www.bitchute.com/) now!
This might mean YouTube is in bed with Soros.
Everyone PLEASE use Vimeo for your video uploads! Take away Goolag's ability to make money! It takes no effort AT ALL to use Vimeo instead of Youtube.
Um try again sweetie, cnn says antifa doesn't commit violence.
Keep uploading them to youtube
/politics is losing their shit because their buddies over at ANTIFA are being labeled as terrorists.
Fuck reddit the only way this shows up on all is if you are subscribed. It doesnt show up at all if you arent. Im not a Trump supporter but I damn sure dont support bullshit bias and censorship. Fucking "World News" has 10 posts about fucking Trump on that sub and politics is an anti-Trump echo chamber I guess unbiased information is just not popular on reddit. 
YouTube is on the attack, to them the only free speech is liberal free speech.
It's one thing to have those videos flagged for violence, but trying to hide the evidence is crossing the line.
I'm shocked! This post is actually on /ALL
What is an alternative to Youtube?  Google is censoring thought and free speech.
I think we should all leave youtube. It's been a liberal shithole for years, and it will only get worse. Next thing you know, they're gonna be supporting Antifa and BLM! We need to go on a mass exodus from youtube elsewhere.
[deleted]
The Youtube branch of Google is so incompetent that they can't be profitable with a billion viewers.   We need to complain to the advertisers on Youtube about their crazy censorship policies and that they are linking their brands with 1984 level censorship machines.   Of course, alternative sites are also a good idea.
Google needs to be shut down and broken up.
oh know better SHUT IT DOWN BOY
And we can't do a thing about it.  That's on us. 
I'm one of the folks behind https://pew.tube, feel free to come upload that material there, we don't censor unlike Slimy YouTube! 
[deleted]
Wow they really. If you search "Antifa violence" you can't find any that aren't over a month old all of them are like less then a week old. 
At least we know who youtube is siding with but I don't understand, whether the violence comes from the alt right or the alt left, both should be called out because it's morally wrong, why would youtube try to cover up violent incidents from antifa? Everybody should be able to see who antifa really are. Thing is, a lot of people have the misconception that antifa are the good guys while reality is that antifa are a bunch of hypocrites and assholes that will use extreme violence if they don't get their way. I hope these people open their eyes eventually.
They're censoring practically everyone lately. It's fucking madness.
They aren't deleting them, they have a system where if enough people report a video it gets taken down.  Antifa are most likely organizing rate downs en-masse.
Youtube are full on SJW, Google even have a diversity SJW "thinktank" that's all rainbow colored haired fat women **facepalm** 
Sounds like Google wants to be made an accessory, then.  
Good thing I'm posting them on porn websites. Where I get my real news. 
I've been chronicling the videos on Facebook, and every single one that I posted has been removed from Youtube.
Wish I didn't have to use YouTube. I'm getting my engineering degree so the videos really help. Hate what is happening right now. 
Well, look at who owns YouTube.
What do you mean? They are all over YouTube right now.  I think the ones being deleted may be too graphic and whoever is uploading may not be specifying that.
# Could someone please link me a compilation of antifa violence?   I would like to send it to some of the upper class leftists who surround me in my city so they can get a real sense of who these *peaceful protesters™* are.
Youtube thinks its 1984
This is seriously fucked up.
Someone please recommend an alternative  I'm ready to boycott that shit  Is Adblock enough or should I be doing something different altogether?
Here's one they haven't deleted  https://youtu.be/KGWmzGoQzgU
We still have live leak. 
These are truly dangerous times 'pedes.  We're literally the last line of resistance between a leftist totalitarian police state and freedom.    They will censor anything and everything that doesn't fit their pre-conceived notions.  Archive everything, and have backups ready for when the blackout arrives.
Good news is the DOJ has all the evidence they need.  ANTIFAs days are severely numbered.
Arm yourselves. When you see something good, use something like VideoDownloadHelper (if you use FireFox) to save it, then repost appropriately. If OP uses a YouTube link that goes down, the mirror should be in the comments
Another issue to be aware of: the @DFRLab @AtlanticCouncil's Digital Forensic Research Lab. Has been analyzing accounts and the flow of stories in twitter. The Fire McMaster hashtag is one that was recently analyzed. [(story)](https://medium.com/dfrlab/firemcmaster-explained-9e9018e507c2)   This baloney, combined with the silence on YouTube and the crap in Reddit called "both sides" is aimed at chilling free speech and discouraging social media use. This then favors the big networks.  
Antifa is just as facked up as the KKK in regard to their extreme views and as a non-Republican, I can say I've seen them start fights FAR more than the far-right.   I think hate speech is dangerous but I think people not being able to see what they're doing is far far more dangerous. They need to be seen for who they are, misfit sheeple that think they're edgy by wanting communist values in America. fuck that. 
Youtube is out to lunch these days.

I really dislike what they are doing. Hopefully, if this behavior continues a good alternative will get some foothold. Alphabet should stay out of partisan politics. Everyone should be upset.

Just do what people do to avoid copyright. Put weird backgrounds and change the video speed to .75. People can easily change the settings and YouTube is helpless.
Not that it's excusable, but is it possible that youtube automatically removes videos that receive over a threshold value of flaggings from SJWs (or shariablue bots)?  Or is there reason to believe an actual YT/goolag employee saw it and thought "nah wrongthink gotta keep the brownshirts safe"

Not surprising. YouTube is notorious for being extremely bias. 
figures.what loser assholes.
So about Twitch..
CommieTube
Where is our hero, Redt00b in this desperate hour to host G/PG vids?
YouTube is now a happy-feelings-only place for makeup tutorials, DIY's and non-offensive vlogs.  People need to use other serious video platforms that don't sensor based on political viewpoints.  Minds.com is a good one, but I'm sure there are others too. 
In case anyone wants to know what the first video to be "limited" was by Youtube's newfound experiments in censorship, [it was this, a perfectly reasonable and calm video about race that had *nothing* hateful in it besides apparent offensive facts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SJNVb0GnPI&bpctr=1503962448). I encourage you all to watch it.
I bookmarked this thread to check out the changes that occur.
Let us not forget that the CEO of this website would rather do away with every shred of integrity his own website holds than effectively deal with his criticisms. This man stands for censorship and against freedom of speech. It's time for /u/spez to step down with grace.
His non-apology was shocking in how bad it was.  He turned it into an attack on this dom, so of course all the comments were in total support.  Fuck you /u/spez. 
They did it. They banned the subreddit without closing the subreddit. As I look on r/all right now there is absolutely no The_Donald on any of the first few pages. However there is still EnoughTrumpSpam and of course politics post decrying their hate for Trump and conservatives.   Edit: At the time of this posting which was >4 hours from this edit and 30min from announcement, There was absolutely no The_Donald on over 6 pages of /all . I come back later after a class on campus and i click on r/all and there we are again. Not sure what is going on now and if they lifted it for now ...but at the time of their announcement this sub was completely censored.
Spez is truly a cuck. He has no real power. He is a puppet to his corporate owners who bought this site out years ago in order to silence the viewpoints that had gained prominence here.   This whole platform is a hotbed of censorship and false propaganda and they are looking for any way possible to silence this sub and any others like it.   It is not a matter of if but when. 
What's going on with this anyway?  Is Reddit punishing him in any way?
Nah didn't you hear? He doesn't agree with our politics therefor it should be banned. Tolerant left
If by "with grace" you mean "in shame", then yes.
I don't know guys..but...his face just makes me want to hit it with a frying pan.

Ban a sub with over 300k? Is he crazy? Does he really want to watch Reddit burn?
can we stop demanding for him to step down, i feel like its a stupid thing to do considering he is CEO. what is he going to do fire himself?
He looks ill to me, he should get a brain scan and possibly spend some time recovering in a mental hospital like Kayne.

Our sub was quarantined without being put in quarantine status. Fuck this guy. 
In disgrace. 
I don't visit /all or the front page, I also deleted all the default subs from my home page so this doesn't effect what I see. However, the more I learn about this guy the more apparent it becomes he's a spiteful little prick.   voat.co may not have as many people but speech is not censored like it is here.  
Spirit cooking, pizza eating, ping pong playing, dirty bag of laundry.
Soon the entire internet will be editted so that only the popular opinions are shown.  Get ready, it's coming.  
he has no style, he has no grace  this cuck  has an ugly face
I heard this guy fucks children.
Looks like a blank. 
I find it funny how liberals want to take away our freedom of speech, but yet they burn flags and call that freedom of speech. 
Didn't realize u/spez had down's syndrome, poor guy.
GROSS, is he albino??
[removed]
I seem to have a different opinion in this but I don't think it's going to matter.  We're still high energy as fuck and we don't need our moderators cherry picking the best posts here anyways!  In fact this will make it even harder to correct the record because they won't know where to focus their attacks. 
The only *grace* in his life is when Tyrone *graces* his wifes bed
spez has adopted the liberal strategy of doubling down every time they get proven wrong. I bet he kills himself before trump's term is up.
Implying he has any grace.  Cucks lack it entirely.
I wanna scuff that ginger bitch's new nikes.
It's time for him to resign. His legacy as CEO is already disgraced.  FUCK SPEZ
A reminder that this cuckboi actually made national news with his cuckoldry.
/u/spez ' face looks like mushed play-dough.  I've haven't seen such dissymmetry since the Elephant Man.  It's like Steve Buscemi had an uninteresting, uncharming love child with a mixed test-tube of biomass.
fuck /u/spez, lying pedo-protecting POS
**They came first for The_Donald and I didn't speak up...**  The cucks think it ends with The_Donald? They think their own subs are immune from such actions? Sad!
Spez is NOT against free speech. That is ridiculous. He is only against speech that he disagrees with and to do everything in his power to prevent anyone else from reading it. :p
So let's migrate to another platform. Clearly we have the technical resources. I've been in tech/server world for 10 years and can figure the gear and hosting out and depending on cost probably that as well so let's organize and split. Enough is enough. Let's take our MAGA and go.
Fuck Reddit, everyone a cry baby bitch anyways.
Why is no one talking about the fact that this subreddit wouldn't of gotten as popular if it wasn't for the deleting and censorship of conservative articles in /r/[REDACTED], even kicking out a Trump supporting mod? Redditors came to this subreddit as an outlet because of the inaction of the admins to address what was going on in /r/[REDACTED].
Gets caught editing to fit the liberal narrative. introduces safe spaces into reddit. What a fucking tool. Welcome to 1984, brothers and sisters. We're guilty simply by thinking of posting here.
Is this guy mental?? Does he really think that silencing a subreddit that has more than 300k would be beneficial for the whole reddit community? This site is fucked.
Even his face is crooked.
I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but adding subreddit specific filter rules for just r/the_donald is just too much. He has to go back! OUT! OUT! OUT!
This guy is a pathetic excuse for a CEO.  In way over his head.  /u/spez it's time to resign and let someone who knows what they're doing take the wheel.
look at him you think he ever got laid without paying? he can ban me all day long, I dont need reddit that bad to create another anon account.. this is my one account ban me oh well  might just spark me to start my own reddit style site and do you proud governor 
Manchild 
/u/spez is petrified of us 
FUCK YOU /u/spez 
Fuck /u/spez

Fuck this fucking pedophile. 
he lost all grace just get out before you make yourself look any worse
Its kinda pissing me off that they are trying to frame the response to his editing comment as 'the trolls getting pissed off that they got trolled' as though that was the actual issue.   Talk about not seeing the wider ramifications of your actions...fucking hell. 
He looks like a cannibal.

Looks like a cuck.  Talks like a cuck.  Walks like a cuck.  Must be a CUCK

Blonde hair, blue eyes. He'd fit in back during the nazi Germany days. 
He looks like someone who was picked on in school. Now he's getting revenge.
Is it too late to bring the Asian chick back?  She was a cakewalk next to this ass clown.
We should get Tucker Carlson to interview him. It would be awesome to see u/spez get torn apart for being so stupid.
Everyone subscribed to the donald drumpf fanpage is truly truly cancer. DEPLORABLE! SAD!

if he ends up giving that money to Flint, MI my head might explode from the awesomeness.

#EVERY DAY IS A CHRISTMAS BIRTHDAY HALLOWE'EN THANKSGIVING PARTY FESTIVAL OF INFINITE JOY!
Guys, I'd like a little information. I've recently became interested in politics after this election.  So the $221m gift to Palestine was for humanitarian aid? I mean, what for? Are we talking about Obama trying to fund the ongoing Israeli-Palestine issue?
Let's announce to use the "exact" amount to fund something else without reference to the Obama's action. 
If if it if if if Im not President anymore my legacy is ruined Okie Doke 
Send it to Flint... approval rating will sky rocket 
God Bless President Trump.  He's always thinking of us first.  Maybe an executive order can reset the whole thing.
Suddenly, I am not as upset at sending $14k/yr to the federal government.
So we've been sending money to Palestine and Israel effectively fueling the war between them? 
[deleted]
Trillions in debt and we're giving away hundreds of billions with 0 expectation of return. WTF Obama. 
What's the r/redacted spin on this?  How are they trying to make it a negative?    Let me guess... racist Trump steals money from Palestinians  EDIT: I was wrong.  Apparently they are trying to make the case that Nazi Trump did this to screw over Israel, because he hates the Jews.
Great news, really it is. Its no secret that the PA essentially funds terror attacks against Israeli civilians. 
I was skeptical, but we are to judge him by his fruits.    So far it's been 100% MAGA like we've never seen before.
I'm all for sending the Palestinians and Hamas $221 million, as long as it's in the form of ordnance and delivered by the IDF.
Obama sure did offer other people's money freely.
It's bold moves like this that affirm my vote was cast for the right person.
PRESIDENT Trump is bending Obama's legacy over and fisting the shit out of it and I love it.  
Did I say, "I love this President!" He has the balls to do what is right and does it fast.
USE IT TO FIX THE WATER SYSTEM IN MICHIGAN! WE WILL FIX OUR WATER SYSTEM AND THE PALESTINIANS WILL PAY FOR IT!   Basically, yeah. If we had elected Hillary, that money would be gone gone gone.
I woke up this morning, got on TD and I was in shock at just how much we (as a nation) were winning. I felt something strange. A feeling crept over me that I hadn't had since I graduated boot in 08. I felt pride, not in myself or my accomplishments but pride in my nation, for what it is and what it could be.   I got chills, I need a coat.
**FREEZE KEBAB**
This is fucking savage. Obama must be shaking 
Our President is the best, our country is suffering - why are we giving $221 million to these people?!
I say we give the $221,000,000 to the "Palestinians" in the form of bacon.
Can anyone else find a verifiable source for this? 
God bless this man. What a lion.   The Palestinians don't deserve our tax dollars. We need that money to rebuild America.
Good. I hate that they use "Palestinians". The money was not going to innocent poor Palestinians. It was essentially going to the leaders that support terrorist organizations. 
Don't you just love how while all the lefties are getting in marches about their sexual organs, he's getting more work done in a week than Obama in the last 2 years of his presidency.
"Cool terrorism, Palestine. Want to bring their destruction to America? Here's $221 million dollars. We should inspire more nations like you to follow the true words of Muhammad; death to all non-believers."  - Barry
This money belongs to the US to be used for infrastructure improvement. 
Fix Flint with this money and bask in the Glory of helping the African American community that Obama turned his back on!
Man for claiming to be a Christian Obama certainly sympathizes with radical Islam A LOT. 
This is the best ally Israel could ask for. I thank everyone who voted for him.
And the WINNING continues!!!  Fuck you Obama!!!  Fuck you Soros!!!

lol hezbollah STUMPED
Thank fucking god. I'm glad President Trump was able to stop a fucking (then) president from ACTIVELY AIDING AND ABBETTING TERRORISM.   It's fucking sad that he even had to waste his time doing this
I'll reserve judgement until we get results. I was under the impression that Trump had no say in this.
Why exactly did Obama give them the money? Any other reason other than he's Muslim?
Hussein Obama now chewing soap!
Sorry, Al Jazeera. Hamas cannot buy weapons now to create a war in March, looks like you'll have to find another way to get high ratings

Guys I can't take all this winning.
You know what that can go to?  #WALL MONEY BABY
Malik's brother on suicide watch!
biggest state sponsor of terrorism = Obama
Tell him to make the check payable to snoozebum I will sleep well knowing my pockets are lined with taxpayer money. Nah I would give it away to charity with a small handling fee say 90% or so that's the going rate for handling fees on charities these days right?
Nice. About time we stop the war on Christiani- oh wait..
Good, the corrupt Palestinian government was going to steal it from the people anyways. 
We should end non-humanitarian foreign aid across the board.
It's as if everyone in the USA gave 0.69 to Palestine.
Flint's water system would cost between 200-250 Million to fix. Just saying. 
Woah! This is great news! I would have totally thought it would have been out the door and in their hands already. 
Why do we give out foreign aid when we are 19trillion in debt and have homeless vets.

**HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH A.   NO FREE RIDES SCUM**
Quit sending money, period. The reason these wars last forever is because somebody is funneling money. Enough already.
Yeah Pres Trump.  Don't give them anything.
#DIVERT IT TO FLINT GOD EMPEROR
Shit, there's your wall money right there.
This is totally misleading.  Nothing in this article or in the articles cited in this thread even claims, let alone demonstrates, that the money was "frozen."  To the contrary the information strongly suggests that the money was in fact "released" to the Palestinians on last Friday morning BEFORE the inauguration.  Obama got away with this treasonous ploy by all indications.  
Spread that money around for the homeless and under privileged Americans who are currently suffering on the streets. Fuck Obama.
nice try obama
This is such a stark difference from Obama in how to use power, or how to be "the boss." Obama didn't seem like he believed he was President back in 08' and just bent over, over and over again. Trump shows he has experience being the head of a large organinzation. It's so fun to watch. 
MEET YOUR 2016 AND 2020 PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN BTFO

They artificially put it at 0           Oh well guess you got us...oh wait, Trump is still president.

This one definitely triggered these cucks.  "2020!? Omg he's Hitler! He'll never be re-elected!"  Ha. Bring it on. We took down the biggest political operation in history. The Clinton Machine reinforced with Obama's fake Hope & Change grassroots. Whomever they put up is toast.

Holy shit. Hillary Clinton came into my room to bring me a jar of pickles and I literally screamed at her and hit the jar of pickles out of her hand. She started to have a seizure and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do about the barbells that keep falling on me. I didn't mean to do that to Hillary but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is she losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe Trump knows how to campaign without celebrities. I want to be culturally enriched by refugees. I want Hillary to be president and let in more refugees. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought they were correcting the record???? This is so fucked.

I'm so happy
Couldn't find her when I googled "RACISM", can we fix that?
Looks like MTV pulled it from Youtube and Twitter.  #[Mirror #1](https://vid.me/sN2Y) #[Mirror #2](https://streamable.com/e30cj)  [Here is an article with the details](http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/12/19/mtvs-new-years-resolutions-for-white-guys-stop-mansplaining-stop-saying-woke-blue-lives-matter-isnt-a-thing/)  Please reply to this post with mirrors.
As a white male I was so impressed by her wit and snarkiness that I made a new years resolution to be more self loathing in 2017, like she suggested.  As such, I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for the slavery imposed on black Nubians by white Ancient Egyptians.  That was seriously wrong how they were forced to build those pyramids, and I accept personal responsibility for that tragedy, as all white people should.  
Who signed off on this, do we know?   Their job should be terminated.  
They just don't get it.  They learned nothing from the election. All they are doing is pushing middle America further to the right.  They may never see the White house again.
she's so cute when she makes air quotes during her racist speech 
[deleted]
Honestly...it's good that Hillary won the popular vote.  These people are doubling down on craziness under the guise that "most people voted for Hillary."    What they don't realize is that they're turning more and more people away every day and the end result is going to be a dwindling voter base, with a few dozen fervent SJWs in SoCal and San Francisco as all that remains by 2020
Trump will finish the SJWs

The regressive left is racist.
I usually shrug this kind of stuff off and roll my eyes, but this getting scary. I mean fuck, a specific demographic is being called out. This is blatant, vitriolic hatred. These people openly resent us. What kind of Twilight Zone shit is this? Only a year or so ago, I considered myself somewhat progressive and was voting for Bernie, but Trump's bleeding red, white and blue is exactly what we need right now. If it weren't for him being elected, can you imagine how far this shit would go?
> "2016 was bad"  Fuck them, best year in a long while.
Why are liberals so obsessed with race holy shit
Just so you guys know, us Latinos don't just sit around all day thinking "damn white people are racist". Most of my friends throughout my life have been white skater kids and metal-heads who are chill as fuck and race never comes up unless we're joking around. Most PEOPLE aren't racist. Sure there are a ton of racist assholes out there but calling an entire group of people racist is fucking stupid and counter productive. Sure, some white people are racist as fuck. I know quite a few fellow Mexicans that are pretty fucking racist as well (sometimes against their own). Judge people as individuals. Treat everyone you meet with respect unless they give you a reason not to. I'm a left leaning, gun owning, Mexican-American that sees through the divide and conquer bullshit that both sides of the establishment have been pushing for decades. 
The air quotes and condescending tone of the people in this video make me want to punch the first kid with big glasses and a pony tail on the side of their head that I see. Blech!
Whites are clearly under siege. Next up will be Asians (not the BBC kind who are actually fucking Pakis), who come to this country and actually work hard and succeed.   The left is completely fucked
People who do air-quotes with their fingers, in a video, should have their hands beaten bloody with a sledge.

God damn, if there was a fucking video about "things that black women need to work on in 2017" people would be up in fucking arms. This is so fucking racist it's not even funny 
I don't know if [this guy is based,](https://youtu.be/6f17cDQVK5c) but even he agrees this video is racist. And he's black. 
Goddamnit MTV.  100% CUCKS
Who is this? I don't know, but if the 'pedes hate her, I hate her.
Racism. If you upvote this, this image will show up when someone searches "racism"
I'll do her anal so I won't appear racist as a straight white male.

It used to be when topics of racism came up people would suggest.  "Put "Black people" in place of some other racial group when you are making a statement, and if it sounds racist it probably is."  "2017 Resolutions for Black guys"  Yep that sounds pretty racist, this seems like a bad idea.  Now I guess the suggestion is "If its about white people its fair game."  
Thanks MTV for bringing the subtle anti-white male narrative to a tipping point so we can finally fucking do away with it 
LOLOL. I downloaded it immediately yesterday.  Good luck keeping that shit off the internet MORON TV
Is there a list of the actors and actresses in that shitty video?
All they are doing is guaranteeing Trump to be in for eight years.
How does this work?
Thirsty Beta Bait
Biggest fucking racist of them all! Propaganda!
Is the one chick America Ferrera? 
That and flat head.
Her eyes scream crazy!
And to think I was worried the left would clean up and make themselves competitive in 2020.  Looks like with Don, Ivanka, Eric we have 24 years of Trump 
Idk who this chick is but I already want to punch her in the face
Oh MTV. I wonder if all the the racist minorities you are pandering to realize that all your executives are white:  http://www.mtvpress.com/executives
 Just saw the video - Jesus Christ what a bunch of smug idiotic fucks.  I just want to say one thing out loud.  'Mansplaining' is when a woman doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about and needs to be corrected.  It also happens between men-to-men as well as men-to-dog.  It's what men do - we see something we think is wrong, and we correct it.  Correcting/explaining something *is not taking your rights away you God damned identity politics playing fuck*.  I need a glass of water.
r/The_Donald Making money for Reddit and Steve Huffman Yet you bitch about hating Reddit. I send my love from frontpage Welcome back Long time no see. Long live the God Emperor DJT
Oh boy, more racist agitation from the left.  Liberals, crap like this is why you're subhuman scum.
Wow i finally watched this. Im half white and half puerto rican. Am i a racist white person? Where is my class guys!!!! I dont have an option other than other!  Cucks gonna stay brainwashed because they can not accept their pardigrim changing LOL
WTFriggty Fuck. We need to pinpoint each exec that was involved in this. Each actor in this ad, each producer, we need to flip there world over. We cannot allow to continue this behavior, all we are asking for is to stop the prejudice of white men.  Racism and prejudice does exist against white men. Difference is we aren't a bunch of whiny oily skinned granolas that whine about not getting our way.   If you disagree take a good look at /r/publicfreakout and get back to me. The overall sampling is of blacks, Hispanics, and SJW's of all sizes as colors. Rarely is it straight white men.
Honestly, i thought the white chick was the worst. Just the way she complains about manspreading like she is untouchable and her opinions unrefutable. That is the attitude of most of these sjws and why its gonna be a long road to fix them.
Try googling retarded. 
She's  so diverse.  Imma cry like cray when the ice be woke  and she deported
Fuck this condescending racist bullshit
My liberal friends, college educated, very articulate, government and NGO bureaucrats mostly, to even question the assertions being made in this Mtv infomercial, would be a tell tale mark of a racist. I always figured live and let live, let them think whatever crazy things they want, but they have gotten really bad since losing the election, it's doubled down racism-sexism-misogyny-islamo-homo-Xeon-phobia-anto-Semitic-nazi-skinhead-david-duke-kkk everywhere they look, and I just can't be around thought police in the midst of a meltdown anymore. 
RACIST AF
I bet this (air quotes) CUNT (end air quotes) isn't smiling now after all the negative attention this video is bringing upon the idiots in this video.
If anyone ever asks me why I think millennials are insufferable and ineffectual I'll just lady-slap them with a link to this. 
Keep doubling down motherfuckers... see what happens.
Can one of you folk much smarter than I am NAME AND SHAME this racist bitch?
I'm 6'2 with long blonde hair and blue eyes, and I probably get more dirty looks than Rosa Parks on a bus.

I AM LITERALLY VIBRATING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THIS VIDEO
i hate how it's acceptable to be racist to whites. 
i saw this vid referenced and figured people were making a bigger deal out of it than it was but holy shit, what were they thinking? Is this really the norm now?

Not a hint of testosterone in either one of those white guys. Kek. 
This commercial actually angered me. Huh.
I don't really see what this has to do with Trump but it's definitely racist and fucked up. I'm pretty disgusted by how MTV thought this was ok. Who the fuck green lit this piece of shit?
They are mansplaining why mansplaining is bad it seems like 
So how can I make sure all of these mofos show up as racists on google?
Welp ... this is about as racist as it gets ...
Does anybody know this idiot's name? She looks like some kind of adjunct professor of Rape Culture.
Why are they so triggered I don't get it where is the "Woke" coming from? 
We did do better in 2017. We elected Trump to stamp all this racist nonsense out!

Amy Schumer promised to leave for Canada if Trump wins, billboards are popping up in LA exposing her for not following through
People are really starting to turn on Hollywood
I think she should move to Saudi Arabia.  I am sure they will love her there!
Same thing happened with Bush, none of them moved. Why the fuck they say it escapes me, they can only look like liars. Schumer actually said she was moving to Spain, even further away.   I hope we remember Schumer's lie forever, she should keep her word and go.  
To be fair, Canada don't want Amy Schumer too.
Come on over Amy, it's time.
Based Hannity has a chartered plane ready to go for anyone who wants it. 
This is nothing compared to the shit she pulled leading up to the election. Here she is on twitter shaming people into voting:  https://twitter.com/amyschumer/status/794305753255444481      (Trigger warning: Amy Schumer talking) 
She should go to Somalia. Anything else wold be racist and islamophobic. 
Canada isn't some dump where you can throw your Amy Schumers... send that mouthy piece of work to Mexico. 
For fucks sake America, throw your garbage towards Mexico and keep us the true north strong and free!
Too fucking bad. I'm sure she would have had a successful Gofundme to move out of the US...but she would probably lie about it and take the money anyway just like liberals do.
She deleted all her tweets after November 5th. Priceless.   #pack your bags
is this real?
#OUT OUT OUT
**WE HAVE THE BEST BILLBOARDS, DON'T WE FOLKS?**
I like the fact that people are tweeting these self-righteous celebrities to their own words. You can tell that the blow to their Ego, that all these people actually don't like them, really does affect them on a deep level. And that's what happens when your life come from people ignoring you and liking what you do, you basically get psychologically destroyed when you're showing the contrary. It's hilarious.
This is by based street artist Sabo. He made them for multiple celebs who threatened to leave: http://www.theamericanmirror.com/photos-l-street-artist-posts-moving-sale-posters-anti-trump-celebrities/
I see the comments on some of the articles that talk about these mock ads. Personally, I think they are brilliant. About the comments saying it goes too far??? Really. Celebrities came out in droves to tell YOU how to vote. More than that, they thought they could manipulate their millions of fans to do so at the threat of not having their favorite celebs around anymore.   I am the type of person that when I say that I will do something, I follow through with it. If someone tells me they will do something, I take it as gospel and fully expect you to follow through with it as I would. When asked what I would do if Hillary won (if liberals asked they would say "when") and I simply said I would do everything I can to make sure that word would get out on her criminality. I would have, done everything I could to expose her, and hopefully educate people about the ills of globalism.   It might not have mattered because in a short 8 years our country would have surrendered its sovereignty, many rights, and the groundwork for our take over would have already begun. This was a serious election, quite possibly might have been our last true election if it wasn't for Trump winning. I take it very seriously and these assholes for the last year have been saying if he wins I am moving, I am dead serious I am gone. Over and over again for the entire year.   Good you don't like our country, or the choice of the majority of people (regardless of what lies the media tell you) then get the fuck out. Go to North Korea, China, Venezuela... Anywhere but where WE decide, the people not some douche bag that is over paid that can barely act anymore like DeNiro. Buddy your best years are behind you, retire gracefully & stay out of politics when it comes to your celebrity persona.  ./ Rant
Can I donate with Bitcoins to the this ad's campaign? That's awesome.  Shut up and take my money!  No seriously, where can we donate?

She can't move... the weight redistribution would cause a geological shift that would... cause California earthquakes and landslides.
She is really ugly. Could do with losing some weight too.
hey guys last night   *snickers*   i stuck a win bottle in my vagin   *muffled laughter*   but then i got drunk because of the wine in my vagin   *hearty laffs*   and THEN two guys started spitroasting me!   *full on laughter*   so i started deep-throating a big ass weenie   *laughter starts exceeding 90 decibels*   and then i got high and raped a guy   *laughter is close to approaching 130 decibels*   BUT THEN   *everyone in a 3km radius has blown out eardrums, the pain threshold is exceeded and quickly increases*   CHECK THIS   *the military is preparing for the final solution, as now the laughter is a national threat*   NO SERIOUSLY   *the whole earth is shaken by the loudness of the laughter, like millions of earthquakes around the planet, the human race is taken hostage by Amy Schumer*   I SWALLOD THE CUMMIES   *it is now year 2200, long after The Laugh. Most of the human race didn't survive the apocalypse that happened after some really funny jokes made by The Amy Schumer, the only one's that survived were, maybe by faith, an ordinary man and a woman. As the earth had to rebuild itself from dust, it was fitting to name these two Adam and Eve. It was beginning of the new order, and new planet earth. It is now close to 200 years after that incident, and we still haven't fully accustomed ourselves to our new enviroment. Not new to us, since we were born after the apocalypse, and the only information about the past we got from tales of the old timers. If this works, and someone out there can hear us, stop her. Do whatever is needed, one persons death is nothing compared to billions of bodies, rotting, decomposing, and now forgotten.*

Like, did she actually think someone in say the midwest or coal country was thinking, "Hmmm, I don't have a job anymore and this guy is promising jobs.  I WAS going to go for Trump...but if I do that, then AMY SCHUMER MIGHT LIVE IN CANADA!  OH NO!  Better vote Hillary!  I get by on welfare, but the comedic stylings of Amy Schumer are all I have left in my life.  Gonna make the smart choice here."
Send he to the ISIS training camp in Mexico to see if she likes it there. Fuck you fat nasty pig, get the fuck out of our country, take your buddies with you!
Why do people say I'm a misogynist when I point out the fact that Amy Schumer is pig fucking ugly? Are there no ugly dudes? What is the logic here? 
and take Lena Dunham with her! 
Of course they want to move to the whitest country on the planet. Fucking racists.

Ads are getting funny and creative. 
C'mon, Canada can hold Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham. Lena fits into the Northwest Territories, and Amy's fat ass fits into Nunavut. It'll be a tight squeeze but you'll cope. We can even throw Rosie O'Donnell into Yukon.
LOL is the website  get  the  fuck  out  of  here  .  today
Shoo, shoo, Amy Shoomer.
Let's continue the pressure and make her leave.
lol people can't agree on Trump but they can agree they are tired of hearing Amy's stand up about how much of a fat slut she is... 
Don't let the wall hit you on the way out. 
Trust us, a lot of Americans want Amy Schumer out of America too. 
Why did they use a glamour shot of her instead of showing her as the piggy that she really is. Funny how these celebrities defend Mexico and the wall, but always turn to Canada if they need to leave.
>"Haha, honestly if that racist xenophobic Trump guy wins I'm outta here!  >Haha, nah, I'm not going to move to a poor low-HDI country full of brown people or anything. Haha, no, I'll move to another rich country with an even greater density of white people, haha!"
Even her hands look fat
The pig must go to Canada!
Go be fat somewhere else.
Canadian here from /r/all.   We don't want her
Most Hollywood people = shallow, no integrity, no word of honor.
Bryan Cranston said he would leave too, but he was smart enough to bend the knee and offer support to President-Elect Trump.
So much spice.
Drain The Swamp is a bi-coastal operation. Hollyweird is next!
I have to admit, I was starting to get a little tired of all the salt. Glad to see somebody SPICING things up a bit.
The shitposting power is too strong!
GET HER OUT OF HERE
Here's more if anybody's interested.    http://www.gtfooh.today/
I feel like Miley can stay because she bent the knee. She gets amnesty for submitting but she is the only one.
she now claims that she was "joking" (because she is a comedian, i guess) ;)
Funny thing is, Canada actually has very strict immigration laws and likely wouldn't let her in. 
Maybe Trump can name her his ambassador to Canada. Then on her first trip revoke her passport so she can't come back.
Canada would you please take this one for the team
Send her ass to Qatar
Joke-stealing cunt :(
All they do is virtue signal, instead of having actual virtue.  "Ohhh...Drumpf is evil. So mean. I'm moving to Canada if he wins".  "How dare you tell me to move to Canada you sexist, racist, chauvinist,misogynist, Islamophobic, homophobic, transphobic, fucking white male."
Don't all comedians have dual citizenship with some Commonwealth nation anyway? I thought it was practically a rule that the Canadian shield provided our surplus of professional humorists.
I really hope this is real. She's gonna go into hiding soon. 
Don't. She'll get stuck halfway and plug Niagra Falls.
I don't want that fat cunt in my country. Send it to Mexico.
No! On behalf of all Snow Mexicans, we do not want her!
As a hillary voter I support this.
I found a ticket for you Amy!

This is really great. Makes me so happy. I would pay money to a go fund me to extend this campaign. I want to make sure the celebrities see it. 
Hurry up Amy don't vacillate.
Donald Trump's shitposting exits the virtual world and enters the real world.
She's not as attractive as that photo. We're being tricked. 
"i'll leave the country!" that's the adult version of "i'll slit my wrists" pathetic
We don't want her. Sincerely, a Canadian.
Its hard to move to a country that has proper immigration laws.
I wish we could send her to Saudia Arabia for a real taste of freedom 
We don't want her in canada
Can't we just force her into retirement? That way no one will have to hear from her and her stupid "comedy" any more.
Has any celebrity EVER followed through with one of those threats?   It happens at every single election, but I can't think of any time when they actually left.  
mmmmmm why do these celebs always choose a majority white country to flee to.?
The worst thing she ever did was try to get political in her comedy routine.  I even tend to agree with most of what she believes in but politics and comedy rarely mix.. especially when you are just trying to shove your liberal views down peoples throats.  Schumer gets a lot of hate but she kind of caused it all herself.  Plus, she is a joke thief. Can't respect a joke thief. 
All those idiots saying they are going to move to Canada don't realize that Canada has tougher legal immigration laws than the US by a large amount. Tougher even than anything Trump is proposing. If they applied the same standard, something they've amply demonstrated they are incapable of, the government/policy of Canada is hugely racist and xenophobic. 
Canada's gonna build a wall if this keeps up

So gross. I bet she smells like bad fish and wine coolers. Take her if you dare, Canada. Projected to gain 8lbs a year for the rest of her life. Pushing a deuce by 2020.
Whether you are pro or anti Trump we can all agree that this would benefit everyone.

I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results on /r/all. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck can't /r/the_donald stop winning? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a suppressive algorithm to believe in! I cannot fucking deal with this right now.

Just asking but whats wrong with this picture, that it looks *off*? Like, from a technical reason to a person who doesnt do photography. The suit and tie seem blurry but his face is like, oddly textured and sharp or something. 
Hahah get so rekt by the title
Fucking cucked admins
Is this really Trump's official presidential portrait? Tbh it's a little underwhelming, I was hoping for a more interesting composition and backdrop.   From a photography standpoint, Obama's second term pic was really good.
Those don't sound bad actually.  
If that's true, I'm saving this pic as the lock screen on my phone.

BREAKING: U.S. Steel CEO Says 10,000 Jobs To Be Brought Back... All Because Of Trump
Nate Plastic: Why Trump will not create 100,000 jobs before his inauguration. 
Trump at his rallies "We will put American steel in the spine of America" .......He also said the economy and the health of this country would come back quickly. He was right this is all going to build on itself and America is going to come roaring back.
bought US Steel stock three weeks ago.  Up 23% already, not disappointed at all.  Thank you Trump!
President-elect Trump's work ethic has changed my life
The wealth of the middle class of Americans will not be spread across the globe anymore.  We will bring back our manufacturing class.  Get fucked Chyna.  The economic boom that is going to happen in the next 10 years is going to dwarf the 1950's.  
holy shit. This is getting ridiculous (it's not). I don't know how much more winning I can take (no limits) before I succumb to winning exhaustion (I won't).
We should have a Jobs Created Bot

Their name is US STEEL and they shipped jobs elsewhere?  Probably not their fault.  The globalists intentionally created conditions to encourage the destruction of our economic engine!  Trump is rebuilding the engine.  Buckle up Centipedes!  No BRAKES!  
Obama claims credit for the 250k something jobs created in the last month that he had no hand in creating. At this rate though, Trump will single handedly create 650k jobs in a month.
Oh shit! I own stock in them!
That's 61k jobs created already? Too much winning!
CNN: Trump causes wood industry 10,000 jobs by supporting steel.

CNN: U.S. Steel CEO to bring back 10,000 white nationalist jobs 
I'm only 31, and even though I do work a lot I can still find time to bitch about Mondays and the lack of "muh free time". How the hell does this man even function?  His energy is daunting, but I guess that's what I want out of a president. I wonder if we can just get Obama some Groupons to golf courses and inaugurate Trump early. 
[deleted]
I just love how Trump isn't even in office and he's working his ass off to get jobs to stay, while doing victory speeches. That man has to have no free time.
fuck man...he cant even wait to actually be president to start getting shit done....  my tendies are getting hard at the thought of him actually in power at this point....i hope its a goddamn freight train over the liberal legacy.
As the owner of a large steel company in Michigan I hope to be making an announcement this year as well. But it may have to wait till January. Yuuuuuuge.
It's genius, Companies can bring more jobs/not move and go public with it, the pede's will then likely support your company. Win/Win tbh
And that makes 61000 folks, and the man isn't even sworn in
U.S. Steel sounds so fucking bad ass. 
Donald J. Trump the Great Jobs Creator.  Are we entering the Golden age?

It is happening! Amazing, I really didn't expect this. But you know what? Trump is a Businessman. He knows how to do this, it is basic math. Looking forward to him draining the swamp, that will be a cherry on top.

Omg. This is so heartwarming. Even the guy seemed like a nice guy, like he didn't want those employees to go. Imagine being a laid off steel worker and hearing this on a TV in a waiting room or something. Amazing time to be alive.

Really? More winning already? 
Please stop... I can't win much more... I can't. ... TAKE... all this... WINNING!

Thank God, my whole family lost their jobs when they shut down in E TX. Then my husband lost his job as a mud engineer consultant, then me at a dealership because no one was buying anything.  So we are all out of work, the last 2 years fucking sucked.  We had a savings too but with one kid,  two car payments,  rent etc it vanished quickly.  We got out of the vehicles,  luckily we already had one paid off just sitting around. Our lease was up on the house so we moved into FILs home who was a Company man.  It's still shitty,  we live in a HUD property since we live in a oil field town,  businesses shut down and by the time we lost work there wasnt work to be found. Hubs got a call for potential work starting up after Trump gets into office and I hope so.   Edit for more info since I'm not feeding a baby. 
The gears of production are turning again. A resurgence of the great industrial revolution in America.

what are we up to now? 80,000?
All these promises of jobs will add a lot more pressure on congress to get those tax and regulation cuts done in a hurry.   No foot dragging!

But hey, let's talk about how Taiwan is a "thing" (it isn't)
Trump will never win the Presidency   (You are here)  Trump will never bring 100,000 jobs back before his 100th days in office.

Keep in mind, the sticky restriction is **only** for /r/the_donald. If it applied to all subreddits, I would have less of a problem with it. But this blatantly singles out a single subreddit, that /u/spez unapologetically sees as a "problem".  /u/spez and liberals everywhere should honestly ask themselves why this subreddit is seen as a problem. If it's because it's not "left wing flavor", then you're absolutely biased and it would be unethical to single us out.

So u/spez somewhat acknowledges his mistake and makes up for it by smearing and punishing us!  **FUCK u/spez**  **FIRE u/spez**

Has everything on the_donald's front page really been stickied by mods or are we default filtered out of all completely?   Will probably make the landslide for senate Republicans in 2018 even funnier bc the snowflakes will not see it coming isolated in their liberal echo chambers.    Remember everyone, sticks and stones may break your bones, but words are tactical nukes that cause mass destruction. The battlecry of the snowflakes raised in the post 9/11 coddling safespace society.

Conventional meme warfare is no longer viable.  We're going to have to go guerrilla to spread redpills.
What a whiny little bitch.
The tone of u/Spez apology is the exact same tone Hillary had in her "apologies" for what happened at Benghazi and the e-mail scandal. You got caught and were forced to make a statement to save your ass, that is not an apology. Furthermore you tried to act like there was some sort of "good intention" behind what you did. Editing people's comments to say something they did not post is FRAUD you fucking ass and should be the equivalent of treason for the CEO of a company like reddit. And then you continue to paint every user of r/the_donald as some sort of ignorant bully who is only on this website to troll other users and subreddits. r/politics does the exact same thing you are claiming we do to this sub and of course no mention of them. Hillary lost. SJWs lost. you lost. Fuck you. We Won and will keep winning.
#"I'M SORRY I GOT CAUGHT EDITING SO I'M GOING TO TRY AND CENSOR THE BEST SUBREDDIT"  #SPEZ IS THE WORST KIND OF CUCK
What kind of business wants to crack down on the most active people on the basis of personal political opinion?   Can we get a response from the investors? I would think constantly trying to silence us as opposed to granting everyone the freedom of speech would be a conflict of interest business wise.. Unless they don't want profit?
I liked the part where he says that editing the posts was his way of trying to engage us in meaningful dialogue. What a liar, phony, sex watching, loser.
Fuck that piece of shit and his "apology". I want him fired https://www.change.org/p/reddit-steve-huffman-should-step-down-as-ceo-of-reddit  FUCK /u/spez
What harassment is he talking about? How are we "harassing" people, but other subs aren't? You can't just say we're harassing people and give no evidence. And just to be clear, all other subs can get on r/all by using the sticky feature, just not us specifically, right? Also, has he said what he's going to do about the app that automatically downvotes our posts? 
[removed]
Reddit is dead! What the ever loving fuck made him think this was a good idea? Not one mention of /r/redacted either. Sad times. To think a dissenting opinion will be what brings down reddit is sad. 
Hey everyone,  just so we're clear right now..  There's not a single T_D post in the top 75 posts on /all right now. Out of the top 100+ (not even including NSFW posts) there's one T_D post..  Just so we're all clear... This is a much bigger blow to us than just keeping the stickies from making it to the top of /all...  It's phase one of our censorship. 
I like the filter.   It will probably backfire though. Enoughtrumpspam just died. 
*"I have a follow up question: does this new sticky-post behavior only impact /r/The_Donald or its affiliate subs as well?"*  **Spez's response:**  - "**Right now, just them.**  In the past, when a community was deliberately wasting our time, we would look for general solutions that wouldn't single out a specific community. Unfortunately, that usually causes civilian casualties (e.g. when we removed all stickies from r/all and broke sports communities).  **Going forward, we'll just take away their toys specifically and move on.** "    http://i.imgur.com/nhKhURd.png
So we finally managed to get them to give users a FILTER option, not just for gold.        We really are making reddit great again.      Next step is to get this cuck fired and the admin team purged and replaced with professionals.
Can I suck your dick and ask you what obscured retarded archaic editor you use to show I am nerd worthy?
In That Thread: people licking /u/spez bum hole. What a joke.   Peter Thiel, time to start a new platform that's not cucked. 
Fuck this piece of shit. Before, depending on your level of cuckedness, you could choose to believe or  not believe Reddit was censoring r/the_donald. Thousands of users were screaming "There's nothing to see here, stop being crazy ya conspiracy nuts, the algorithm affects everybody". Look at the  mass shift from the "it's not just you" lie to "well you shouldn't have been so mean and now you're censored" truth. So easy for these statist scum.
**Spez just pulled the victim card**...he wrote that he only wanted to troll:  *"I honestly thought they might see some humor in it, we could find some common ground through trollery, and maybe take some of the vitriol out of our relationship."*  http://i.imgur.com/7IE3C9N.png
Seriously, how the fuck does he still have a job?

sore loser
Seriously?  What the fuck?  He fucks up, betrays the trust of *everyone* that uses this site, then somehow turns us into the bad guys?  I absolutely cannot believe he gave such an awful, blame shifting non-apology.  Fuck spez, we have to spend more time on new and rising to make sure we maintain the high energy.  I think it's *hysterical* that we are "toxic" because we hold a different political stance.  The left in a nutshell, everyone.  Edit: New, not all
Hey spez go take a long walk on a short pier!
Classic reddit. They still haven't figured out that increasing censorship just attracts more interest. I'm more than happy to watch liberals continue to live in their own little bubble completely unaware of everything else.
"Many of you are aware of my attempt to troll the trolls last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and explained what I did."  how fucking out of touch with reality are these cannibals? we dont edit comments or put out fake information.  
Liberals lose the election and never saw it coming because they had isolated themselves from all dissenting views. So, rather than acknowledge this and try to expand their horizons, they double down and go for even harsher censoring of opinions that they don't want to hear. Then just throw in a little baseless racist/bigotry name-calling and they think they've solved the problem. What a bunch of fucking morons.

[I just commented in that shitty thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/damht50/)  I love how he fucks up and then blames us for it.
Two times "adjusted" upvote algorithm, manual suppression of the sub by unlisting posts from front page, editing algorithm again (remember when r/all was only t_d), then, massive downvote bots set to downvote everything. Now the final piece: stickied posts ONLY FROM THIS SUB do not show up on r/all. Coupled with bots, skewed ratio and this we are effectively banned. This is how ~~freedom of speech~~ fascism looks like. 
What a cuck... Be a fucking man and step down.
More bullshit.  "I fucked up, but it was really their fault".  And then all the libcucks sucking his dick because the_donald is a sub they don't like.  If this happened on a liberal subreddit they would be up in arms.
[deleted]
reminder that no matter how much you censor the_donald, he's still the president.
[removed]
Nothing from r/The_Donald is showing up on page 1 of r/all right now. 
/u/spez is a cuck. 
Fuck u/spez.
#HAHA Awesome that the Spez, King of the Cucks, gave us the platform to MAGA.  
Never been a subscriber here. Only been in this sub maybe 2 times.   Fuck that guy. I'm protest subbing.   The amount of fucking delusion of calling this sub bully's when the entirety of reddit is liberals bullying conservatives is just mind blowing to me...  That dude can seriously just go fuck himself.
What a piece of shit. Moderates /r/Cannibalism yet WE are "toxic". Fuck you. 
liberal-leaning Independent here.   I don't understand all the drama. I personally follow both liberal and conservative subs including, but not limited to, r/The_Donald; I disagree with most of the extreme right *and* extreme left opinions, but don't understand how anyone can expect to get anything done by simply "filtering out" your opponents views.   Keep your enemies close... otherwise they'll continue to win elections. Or something like that.   Edit: typos. 
the_donald, I just want to say I'm with you guys. I didn't vote for Trump, nor Hillary, as neither of them quite earned my vote with their campaign rhetoric, but I see what reddit has become. I'm currently having a discussion with a prominent mod of r/politics, while being lectured on the side by another, and it's clear they don't have the interests of free speech in mind. Sadly, you guys are alone in your fight, as the bigwigs of reddit do not want you here, but as a casual redditor you have my support. 
Got to fight bullies guys! Donald subscribers are so toxic everyone. I mean its true right? Pedophiles and Criminals should be welcomed by everyone and not be stood up against. Good thing we have /r/[redacted], they are a bastion for friendly and engaging independent thought. Definitely no bullying or toxic behavior there. 
So basically fuck you I don't agree with you. I honestly hope everything that this pedo deserves comes to him... with any luck sooner rather then later... what's the bet u/spez edits this into a death threat, calls wapo for a breaking news story and calls the cops? Nothing but a fucking child molester = u/spez 
How did this moron even make it this far? He has no business being the CEO of a major company
Hey (fuck) /u/spez, can stickies from /r/pedofriends still make it to the front page? 
This post is at the top of /all again nonetheless.
That was a bunch of bullshit. Pure and simple. He has resisted banning T_D in the spirit of healing? GTFO. There are SO many more toxic places than here. He needs to resign forthwith. 
What a piece of shit.
We're are being brigaded right now. Full on attacks against users in this thread. Threatening private mail.  Where are you now /u/spez? You fucking king cuck!
Not a single post of ours is within the first 5 top pages. 
> Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself.  Yeah so more censorship.  > The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting  You could also call that curated content. Though, really, one big reason for mods using stickies like that was to give attention to threads downvoted by CTR shills. Strange that Spez doesn't seem to care about online astro turfing yet seems to consider organic voting important.
What are they so offended about?  I kept seeing people saying that this the_donald sub is "offensive", "sexist", etc.. Which is the the typical Liberal playbook of labels, but I've yet to see any proof of this myself and I'm in this everyday.
This guy is a fucking asshole, and everyone knows it. Go ahead, destroy our 300,000+ strong sub-reddit because of your fucking hurt feelings, and your personal vendetta against those fighting back against the mainstream narrative. I can't wait to see the look on your  face when 300,000+ angry shitposters come flooding through your entire site and infest every single sub on Reddit with a strong counter-narrative to your PC world bullshit.  He shouldn't even be the fucking CEO of the site anymore. What he did completely removes any faith we had in Reddit's integrity. A non-apology, just a sanctimonious "speaking to". He should resign immediately, and let someone who values free speech step in and take the reigns. Tired of these god damn left wing nazis who don't practice what they preach. And I'm tired of their fucking projection.  #WE ARE THE FUTURE NOW. ACCEPT IT AND MOVE ON.

> (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald)  LOL. He must be talking about the shills that only come here to downvote.
Bizarre that a sub supporting the president is somehow toxic. 
The only harassment I ever see on Reddit is against r/the_donald users. Fuck u/spez
finally, I can filter out EnoughTrumpSpam.  That place is a real shithole.
He makes a lot of claims about "harassment" and "toxic" behavior but doesn't have any concrete examples to back up it up. Not that most of Reddit is going to care as he is preaching to a choir that is already prejudiced against this sub. This is far from an apology. 
And this thread just passed spez's on the front page. Lol.
somebody show it to reddit investors
Haha hate us all they want, we're in the White House now mother fuckers! 
Dude he was just trolling all of us trolls.    Fucking moron doesn't even understand the art form. How is editing people's posts that they might not even notice trolling?  Also what does this mean, really?  Someone that commented here before, gets banned on another sub, and they blame /r/The_Donald?  Not to mention I've been banned from multiple subs partially because a mod looked through my post history and saw I comment here.  They explicitly told me that was why they decided to ban me. I wouldn't be surprised if we all start getting shadow banned.  Also is it only stickies that won't appear in /all?  Not that I use that shit anyways, but that's definitely unfair.
Went to reddit.com and this was #1 :D
This will probably get lost but we seem to still show up on r/all. In fact this post is the second one as of right now. http://i.imgur.com/S19rCKK.png
Guys, if we get banned we will move to /r/politics and we won't assimilate. They will have to let us be or we will obliterate them
Can anyone explain exactly what TD has "done" that people are so upset about? I haven't seen a clear explanation. Something that TD has done, or allowed, that other subreddits never allow, or do.
Damn this is getting brigaded hard. If any of you hypocrites read this just know it's going to be okay. I know losing isn't easy, or so I've heard from Hillary supporters.

Fuck /u/Spez.  Abuses his power and shifts blame, singles out and punishes /r/the_donald solely because he and other site mods do not agree with our political views.  Such a joke that this guy is a CEO.
TLDR; u/SPEZ is the embodiment of why Hillary Clinton lost the election.  His reply screams THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS, and is the embodiment of the mentality of the swamp currently occupying DC. The elites and liberals that think they can abuse their power with no consequences because they disagree with their opponents. The elites and liberals that think free speech is only paramount when it is THEIR speech and THEIR viewpoint.  The elites and liberals that think they can do no wrong.   His actions are quite literally DEPLORABLE for a CEO and speak VOLUMES regarding his self-control and decision-making capabilities. He is an embarrassment to executive leadership and his response demonstrates that when pushed under pressure, he chose not to engage in meaningful discourse, but instead act as nothing more than a childish coward willing to destroy the credibility of the very thing he has been entrusted with to grow and protect.  His behavior mirrors the mentality that has overtaken half of this country...well not QUITE half. Luckily, while they are out burning our American flags in the streets and destroying the reputation of their very own companies (while simultaneously burning their personal and professional reputations), we will be outside building infrastructure, increasing jobs, increasing accountability, and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
They doxx, harrass, racist, sexist!!!! Got proof? Naw just our feels!
I love how this subs existence pisses people off and is tearing reddit apart. 
[deleted]
STILL WINNING 
[deleted]
Even in his apology, he continually attacks and vilifies The_Donald. Fuck /u/spez
Now that we are basically invisible to those folks who are so triggered by MAGA I guess the haters will stop brigading and doing massive downvotes on our posts because we'll be filtered out? (seriously most #1 on /r/all posts are downvoted massively but still get to the top of the mountain!).
#number 2 in /all, FUCK YOU /u/spez!
He's going to start false flagging to get this sub banned. Watch.
Just posting as someone mostly neutral that this whole thing was incredibly unprofessional by reddit, and that they will apparently do ANYTHING to prevent diversity of opinion.. bunch of bigots.
This all boils down to one singular thing. Trump won the Presidency. Cucks simply can't handle the fact that they are helpless right now.
#TL;DR: I framed /r/The_Donald, now I censor them. I'm so sorry!
Wow. His letter should be one of resignation. He broke the rules and then blames the Donald for it. What is the site coming to?   I come to Reddit for breaking information so I can choose for myself. How can I trust it now? I have been on Reddit for four years. The Donald truth bombed me. I can't properly express my anger at Spez.

I hope Amy Schumer is honest about it and she goes, I really dislike her as she steals material and is obnoxious.   Celebrities are something I never got, they are regular people that actually have very few unique skills; surprised people even pay attention to them. Most of them will back peddle, count on it.
Good, we don't need them. **OUT, OUT, OUT!!!**
Wonder how many of them will say they want to move to Mexico.
I finally have the fucking courage to stand up to people on facebook. Someone just posted:    "If you voted for Trump today make sure to  explain to your lgbt+, female, black, latino, Muslim friends why they don't matter to you"  I responded with: "Okay I'll tell them I didn't vote for the candidate whose biggest donor enforces capital punishment for homosexuals and woman who are merely ACCUSED of adultery."   I feel so redpilled right now. 
Awwww, Bryan Cranston.

**Its not even january and Trump is already making america great again!**
Trump walks onto stage.    The crowd bursts into excitement upon his entrance.     The camera pans across the audience of beautiful people in red hats and slowly begins zooming in on the Donald himself as his podium enters the camera's frame of view.     With a big grin, the newly crowned 45th president waves to the American people to thunderous applause. A tear in his eye, he glances behind stage and calls out to a familiar face, "Hey Barrack, it's been a crazy election...Get out here!"    Obama, with a look of confusion, hesitantly makes his way on the stage to meet the eyes of a few thousand patriots intently staring him down.    After making it halfway on stage, Obama looks up to find President Trump pointing a finger in his direction and staring him straight in the eyes. He freezes.    "You're fired."     The energy of the building explodes with enthusiasm. Visably upset, Obama runs off stage to a waiting black limo. It slowly drives off.    Trump looks back at the screaming fans and holds his microphone up to his mouth. He pauses and the crowd grows silent waiting for him to speak.     "We're going... to... MAKE. AMERICA. GREAT. AGAIN."    Fireworks go off behind the stage.     Bald eagles are released from all angles around the crowd.     Helicopters fly overhead unloading massive amounts red, white, and blue confetti onto the audience.     A flow of brand new 2017 pickup trucks pull up behind the crowd. Secret service agents unload the truck beds which are full of foam bricks that they pass out to the crowd.     The audience begin passing the bricks forward towards the stage and chants of  "build the wall! build the wall! build the wall..." echo through the stadium.    Donald Trump's family make their way onto stage, gather the bricks, and stack them to form a wall as electric guitar riffs roar over the loudspeakers.     A large American flag rolls out from the top of the stage and drapes behind everyone.    President Trump looks out to all his fans and makes a final announcement.    "I want to make this country great again. Great for everyone."
And don't fucking come to Canada, we don't need you spreading your poison into our political system. Go to Mexico since you seem to be such a big fan of theirs.

Aussie here, the Canadian and Australian immigration sites have been crashed with Americans visiting the sites, this just shows the fucking arrogance that cost them the election.

That six week tantrum was for nothing leftists!  
Trump truly is an inspiration. We had a dark 8 years and Trump shined his light upon us and will take America above and beyond. He was needed more than ever and he stepped up for the people. God bless America and my fellow centipedes...🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

#MY GREAT STATE OF TEXAS PUT HIM OVER THE TOP! THANK YOU TEXAS FOR ALWAYS BEING AMAZING!
Alright I'm just going to come out and say it, and I hope nobody bans me for this... When Trump said I'd get tired of winning, I thought it was hyperbole, but now i'm actually tired of winning. Kinda hard to explain. So I'm leaving now... and no i'm not kidding. -nobody
#RON PAUL GOT MORE ELECTORAL VOTES THAN JEB! HAHAHAHAHA
Winning feels so good three times in a row! I feel so much safer with DJT as our new President!!!
The way the left has been acting has truly sickened me this election. I've always considered myself center-left because of things the far right has done in the past, but hands-down this disgusting push to delegitimize Trump be any means necessary including threats, spitting on the idea of our democracy, by the far left is the worst thing yet.  The ridiculous, nonsensical idea that he is going to destroy the country pisses me off. He could hypothetically be the worst president EVER and he isn't going to destroy the country. Along with all these other attacks of character that have nothing to do with his politics.  I'm glad it's all official now so I have to stop worrying that a violent, ignorant mob influencing what they define as "democracy". I'm glad they hate Trump so much now, because they deserve to see their awful philosophy crumble. Trump, be virtue of winning against all this muck, may actually save the left from it's awful new incarnation by making them realize how anti-reality it is and focusing on the values they are supposed to represent.  Congrats, President Trump. I believe he will do his best to MAGA, and even if he doesn't, these morons need to understand the concept of term limits...

Speaking of winning...  I think it's fair that we give a little shoutout to none other than Crooked Hillary Clinton.  Congratulations, Hillary, you won the greatest number of faithless electors in American political history!  Bravo, ma'am!

Trump lost 2 votes, Hillary, 4 so far, meaning that his margin of victory over her was *increased* by the faithless electors. Thanks, cucks!
The comments section over at r/redacted are hilarious! They actually thought that dissenters would win the election for Crooked Hillary. 
#NO  #BRAKES  # DEPORT ISLAM
Wishcasting this election cycle.   Trump isn't serious about running.  Trump doesn't actually want to win.  Trump won't secure enough votes to secure the nomination.  Trump's nomination will go into a floor battle (Kasich actually believed this one)  Trump's campaign is having a meltdown (at least 8 times this was reported)  Trump has no path to victory  Trump might get faithless electors because of "Muh Russians"  What'd I miss?
>With all Republican states reporting, Trump only lost the two electors in Texas. Clinton lost four electors in Washington state — three voted for former Secretary of State Colin Powell and one voted for Native American tribal leader Faith Spotted Eagle.  Their plan backfired, Clinton lost more votes than Trump did!
Thank my "purple(hahaha)" state!

#AND HILLARY LOST 4 ELECTORS BTFO!!!
However, in Washington State there was a legitimate rebellion against Clinton, where she received only 8 of the 12 electoral votes. Three electors voted for former Republican Secretary of State Colin Powell, while another voted for Native American activist Faith Spotted Eagle.  TopKEK 
Interesting how they call Trump a fascist when their candidate used organized violence to intimidate Trump voters.
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Get ready for the best 8 years ever!!!
Hillary had 4 faithless electors lol
/r/politics is literally quiet right now and possibly crying. 
#JUST HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE WON ALREADY?
Final Tally:  * 304 Trump ✓ * 227 Clinton * 3 Powell  * 1 Sanders * 1 Paul * 1 Kasich  * 1 Eagle 
Does anyone here ever get tired of winning? I certainly don't. HIGHHHHHHHH ENERRGGGYYYYYYYYY 
Congratulations Donald Trump, President-elect of the U.S! Here's hoping the left doesn't try to remove ya simply because their corrupt puppet didn't win.
We need a roll call on this.
Please tell me its over! No more bullshit / recounts..
Good. Now can the democrats stop crying??? Doubt it 
In before celebrities that no one cares about make a video asking Congress not to accept the electors votes. 
Someone asked how Trump could recover from the so-called faithless electors.  Easy answer.  Take the oath of office.
"Notmypresident" lol. Unfortunately for you leftists, history will not see it that way.
Trump won 30 states.  Obama won 28 in 2008 and 26 in 2012.  Trump literally won more states than Obama.
228/304 = .75! Holy shit, she really did earn exactly 75% of what her male counterpart earned for doing the same job! **REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE**

...so you're saying Bernie still has a chance?  
Hmm Hillary lost even more votes, seems like a trend. Grats to President Trump!
So pumped for 4 years of full momentum! America just keeps winning over and over again. MAGA. 
A year ago, 49 people died at Pulse nightclub due to radical Islamic terrorism. Today, The_Donald remembers.
Holy shit... A year ago? Like a whole year? Fuck life goes by fast
This subreddit and KotakuInAction were the only two subreddits where the shooting could be discussed because the mods of News and Worldnews were frantically deleting posts in order to cover up the fact that the shooter was a Muslim.
Not one fucking post on all, not one.
Remember when Omar Mateen's father was spotted at a Clinton campaign rally?
I thought it was a lone wolf?
One of the ONLY Presidents of the USA to support the LBGT community and they just don't get it. I can't tell you how proud I am of my gay based son. He has tried so hard to turn his gay friends around, they in return have turned their backs on him.  He is finding new friends in higher places! We love our President.
As a bisexual woman, I am so glad we have Trump. He, unlike other leaders, wants to eradicate the LGBT hating Islamist savages. I'll never forget this day last year when 49 people lost their lives, and people tried to defend that piece of terrorist shit that murdered them all in cold blood, in the name of Islam. I remember across social media, people were saying "but he wasn't a Muslim, because Islam is a religion of peace", without a thought for THE 49 PEOPLE WHO DIED, OR THE 58 WHO WERE INJURED! God, even worse there was fellow LGBT agreeing with that bullshit. I'm sorry I'm getting emotional about this, but this day just stuck with me, because after it I really started questioning what were the world leaders actually doing to combat radical Islam. The answer? *Nothing*. And what are they doing now? *Still nothing*. They're practically fucking promoting terrorism at this point. Trump is the only one who wants these radical goatfuckers wiped off the face of the Earth. The part I hate is that there's these leaders who say they support the LGBT community, yet they won't fucking do anything about the terrorist fucks who want to throw us off buildings and shoot us in nightclubs. It just sickens me. Best decision of my life was joining you all here, where no one supports all these deluded fuckshits in the media and government who are too busy praying to their ISIS overlords to actually tell the jihadis to fuck off and go combat terrorism. Fuck Islam and fuck anyone who condones their violence, you're all the reason why these 49 people never went home to their families and you should all be so fucking ashamed of yourselves. 
RIP to all 
ooooh I member when other subs tried to hide this news because they're baddies.

This event really disturbed me. Not just because of the senseless killing of 49 people who were out dancing, but how the left threw us under the bus trying to make it about "gun issues" or "internalized homophobia" or "we need moar luv less h8! *rainbow facebook filter*"  It made me scratch my head for awhile. These people, the left, spent years battling against the religious right in defense of us, but when the religion in question has a majority of brown people, we are supposed to make sure we aren't being insensitive?   This tragedy truly made me realize what we (any "oppressed" group) are to the left: fashion accessories. We make them feel good about themselves. They use us to promote how awesome they are, but when someone else higher on the "oppression hierarchy" comes along, they toss us aside for the next big oppression fashion show. They collectively were more outraged by 1 bakery who refused to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple than 1 Muslim who took 49 lives.  This is why that statement "*Without double standards, they wouldn't have any standards at all"* is completely true about today's left. They want to battle "religious oppression" but only if it makes *them* look good doing it.  Perhaps I'm wrong for thinking like this, but ever since this happened, anyone I meet IRL that identifies as left/dem, I don't take them seriously at all.  How can I? Most of the time, it's just placating them because why would I (or anyone) expend any energy trying to get a point across to people who only have a belief system based on shallow thoughts to promote their self righteous, know-nothing ideology?
Whatever issues I may have with the right's attitude towards homosexuality, I want to thank this subreddit for valuing gay lives over Muslim feelings.  That's something we'll never get from the left.
Dear Lefties  who lurk here  I really cannot understand this, there are so many races, religions, colors, nationalities, ethnicity, sexual preferences in this world. If you want to be a liberal or a social justice warrior , you can take any of them to protect.   But why the hell do you have to be so much supportive, to the extent of aggression ( bash the fash) for one particular religion, which wants to kill all of the others mentioned above regardless of  races, religions, colors, nationalities, ethnicity, sexual preferences , including even their own , if they do not follow a fictional book written by a  cruel warmonger in the middle ages.  Why do you think that even criticizing that religion is a crime? Liberals have their priorities ass backwards   Edit: Rip my inbox  Edit: Rip my inbox again. I am copying this question to r/askthe_donald so that lefties can answer there. Though the question was obviously rhetoric as this is T_D and we don't want lefties here.  askt_D link --   https://www.reddit.com/r/AskThe_Donald/comments/6gv4ns/why_do_liberalslefties_specifically_protect_and/ 
Remember how multiple plebbits shut down all discussion of these events because it quickly became obvious the terrorist was a mudshit?  I remember.
Rest in peace everyone.  They did not lose their lives in vain.  Americans woke up to the globalist plot to import millions more Omar Mateens and they said no.
Let us remember not just with thoughts and prayers, like the do-nothing left. Let us remember with action and drive out Islamic terrorists.  Let us also remember that as Orlando was unfolding that the rest of Reddit was actively censoring the news, removing posts from default subreddits because it didn't fit their narrative.  Let us remember that Donald Trump is the first President to enter office supporting the LGBT community and willing to stand tall to fight against sharia law and a culture that literally executes gays while "peaceful, moderate" muslims stand by and watch.  Let us remember that our 2nd amendment means that armed gays don't get bullied. That in the face of terrorism patriotic gays stand their ground and shoot back.  Let us remember that first we are all Americans and welcome any who seek to put America first and Make America Great Again.

I just got banned on the LGBT sub for merely stating facts about how Islam views homosexuality (someone else brought it up, so I just threw in my two cents), I even included links from legitimate, non-partisan sources to prove I was giving them legit info. People asked questions, I gave truthful answers, and they ban me. Since they're too cucked to defend themselves from being eradicated I guess its up to us centipedes to do it for them.
I became a pede a year ago today
I really hope the lgbt community learned something from this atrocity, but it doesn't seem that they have.   "Shoot back" -Milo 
This is why I still like lurking here. On /r/all, you'd think everyone on the_donald was a racist, bigoted asshole. But then you realize that we are all on the same team. Except you know, criminals and terrorists. 
I love all of you RACIST, Xenophobic, **homophobic** bigots!  
Remember, **ISLAM**, not 'radical islam' advocates tossing gays off rooftops.  Where is /r/ Islam when little girls are nailbombed for them? Where is /r/ Islam when gays are shot up for them? Where is /r/ Islam when a pedophile rapes a little girl or boy? Where is /r/ Islam when ISIS beheads a priest or two, or drives a truck over 80 people?   Silence speaks louder than words. ISLAM, and the left's blind acceptance of it is the problem. 
Aye, and remember the fact that The_Donald was the only sub reporting this news while r/ news and r/ worldnews mass deleted post and thousands of comments. Wasn't long after that reddit implemented the "new algorithm" that directly targeted T_D.
A year ago is also when I got red pilled. I already knew I wasn't voting for Hillary, then I noticed that this sub was the only one to be covering this terrorist attack. From that day forward, I knew I had found the other patriots. 🇺🇸
Let's not forget that Hillary had Omar Mateens dad at her rally, and Mateens wife went missing for half a year
such a sad day, I'm not gay, and I never will be, but every last person there was just trying to live life, and some fucking sand dweller came and shot at them cause their sky friend(pedophile) said 'gays r bad k'? fuck islam, and fuck short minded people who think what hole you stick it in at night determines your lifes value. everyone matters, not just black lives, or muslim refugees(do they really still get called that at this point?) or any one group. stand strong today, pedes, and now and forever do not surrender this great land to these fucking savages.
The_Donald remembers that the gay community spit on the graves of those fallen, choosing instead to support Islam
so its been a year that ive supported donald trump.
I remember Paul Henry. I didn't know him well. As we talk about the dead we tend to exaggerate their positive attributes. Paul was in fact by the people that I know and from my own experience an exceptional person. Every day he wore a stylish and professional suit to his sales job. His attitude was a positive and encouraging one. He never failed to say hello to me and to give some kind of nice words to those around him. After news that he was in fact one of the victims, the whole office turned to a place of grief not just for him, but many were close to Paul. A week or so later his daughters came in to collect his things and meet with the director. So many were affected by this event and moved by their loss. When I consider the terrorist attacks carried out by devout islam, I think of Paul. He is the face of how western civilization can be lost as a result of political correctness, and a personal reminder that it isn't far away in some remote land. It's right here.
Notice how this isn't on the top of r/all.   Keep upvoting this 'pedes. Get this to the top. Make the rest of reddit remember. 
B-but CNN told me we hate gay people!
There was some really [strange shit happening that night.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3IV9wuXID0&list=FL85aYVIOb6oKgcs0uv1hDqw&index=241)  The Obama administration used very sinister and tyrannical tactics to take away 2nd Amendment rights. He wanted our guns and so does the entire DNC.   [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiBxr94XINg) is on the ABC News official You Tube channel.  Look at the dislikes, the comments underneath, and then watch the interview closely.  Especially the last two minutes where the woman becomes unraveled and breaks her concentration.   I'm sure everyone despises CNN and Anderson Cooper like me?  [Here's another quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0yN_qM_ZeM) from the official CNN channel  with the same woman.  Again, look at the dislikes, look at the comments, and then watch.    There has been a theme reiterated on this sub over & over but I don't think everyone truly realizes the depth.... Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, the DNC, the globalists like Diversity Fuhrer Merkel and Soros, did NOT WANT Donald Trump to become president. I think Barack and Hillary were globalist pawns in an attempt to slowly maliciously destroy our democracy, take our guns, and then eventually over possibly 20 years turn the USA into a Socialist then Communist dictatorship. President Trump ruined their diabolical blueprint.  If you think I sound crazy, look at what the EU is doing to Europe. They are flooding those countries with migrants to turn the EU into a communist dictatorship.  It is a textbook approach to controlling the population.  It's not simply political correctness.  PC is only a tool.  They LOVE terrorist attacks because it scares the living shit out of the general population.  Also, I guarantee President Trump knows this entire scenario along with all kinds of other insane information.  He is not ""unhinged" or "unstable" like leftists assume.  He's aware this knowledge would terrify Americans, so he simply shuts it down and then goes back to taking care of business. President Trump knows Seth Rich was assassinated by the DNC but he doesn't blurt it out. He just hilariously clowns & trolls the media about the Russian diversion scheme.  Also, I have just now received privileged information, and don't hold me to this, that William Jefferson Clinton, 42nd President of the United States of America, husband of a woman who's globalist alias is allegedly 'Side of Beef' .....was... and is in fact..... a...... this information is too sensitive sorry.  Just go to I N F O W A R S D O T C O M and do a little "investigating."

The downvotes are strong in this thread. 
This tragedy led me to the wonderful group of people here at T_D.  I saw the censorship happening at News and Worldnews and how others were mentioning this place.  Checked it out, and been here to stay.
That was an astonishingly fast year.  We need the travel ban, even if many of these terrorists are 'home grown', guess where their parents come from.  And where they often go to get radicalized?
Easy decision, support the president who doesn't advocate having more people in this country that think I should be killed. 
That was the day I found the_donald. The rest of reddit was censoring the story and the only place that was actually talking about what really happened was here.  I never looked back.  
49 people didn't die. 49 people were *murdered*  Murdered directly because of Islamic ideology. 
~~Islam~~ is poison.  ~~Islam~~ is hate.  ~~Islam~~ is ignorance.  ~~Islam~~ is barbarism.  ~~Islam~~ is backward.  ~~Islam~~ is murder.  **~~Islam~~ is completely incompatible with our way of life.** 
Nothing but love for the LGBT community from this based Christian Libertarian Pede.
It's a shame no one on the left will stand up for these victims or even acknowledge why they were killed.
[deleted]
This tragedy marked the beginning of the end of my transition from man-child to adult. Opened my eyes to the information war and watered the seed of conservatism that had been planted by my first paycheck. 
Remember?  I haven't *forgotten*.  No one should be mowed down because of their *peaceful* theological beliefs or consensual activities they engage in with others.   I am disappointed that there are seemingly so many myopic authoritarians in the gay community who would shun and exile their own because of differing political beliefs and perspectives.   Society is expected to unconditionally and warmly accept gays into the greater community, but internally there's a pecking order of victims, outcasts, etc...all because they voted Trump (or even Hilldawg)?  That's hypocrisy.  It also has very little to do with one's sexual orientation.  You do yourselves a disservice by not banding together in bi-partisan fashion for shared goals and expanding your intellectual horizons through discourse instead of vitriol.  Sad!
I remember trump demanded obama to resign if he didn't use the phrase "radical Islamic terrorism" then obama had a meltdown at the press conference afterwards, then everyone knew he lost control...
Remember when The_Donald was the only ~~sub~~Domreddit to push the story forward?
Make America Great Again!  Make the gay community safe again! 
#Trump shooting speech  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV40c4bPCrA  spez : this is a good speech, you should watch it...
Islam is filth.
This is the day a awoke how censored rnews was
I work about a mile north of Pulse. I wasn't really on board with Trump and honestly, when I finally voted for him it was mostly an anti Hillary vote. However, his speech after Pulse is what made me really take him seriously for the first time. He spoke honestly and with clarity of the problem which exposed how manipulative and disingenuous Obama and Clinton were being.    I wasn't really sure about my vote until I saw Trump winning on election night. I'm glad he won. I support him and I think he has the possibility of doing some really good things for this country. The foremost of these is recognizing and addressing the global jihad underway. 
reminder that T_D was here for us on that day when reddit writ large was *actively censoring it*
Dont forget the left and fake news tried to shovel it under the rug and make it go away by saying it was a self gay hating man and a gun issue.
Annnnnd no where to be seen on /all, fuck reddits supression of the donald 
Radical Islamic terrorism? Please.  CNN told me it was just "gun violence".
Rest in Peace everyone.   o7 Respect and honor for those who were senselessly murdered.
Remember those lost from a horrible crime committed by a terrorist.😞  Love and respect to those who passed away❤  💕We remember you.💕
Don't forget it was also the Christians' fault somehow...
It's a shame the left can't even let a memorial thread stay without jacking it to spew more baseless lies.  Like, they hate LGBT so bad they can't even let them have a memorial post?
This makes me sad to think about... Why are people so horrible
So I guess that we just don't show up on r/all anymore huh? 
Today, liberals:  - don't remember - call you an Islamophobe for remembering - blame Russia
We love our gay friends, don't we folks 
Worst attack since 9/11 in the USA and noone else will talk about it because the shooter was a radicalized Muslim. How pathetic is that?
>radical Islamic terrorism  Redundancy detected.
1 year later and was a proper investigation ever done into the law enforcement reaction that night?  49 people dead after LEO engaged active shooter outside building and massive response w/in few min of first shot fired.  Still waiting on the reprimands and dismissals. 
#[Reminder that Kurt Ecchiwald made excuses for Muslim terrorists and preferred to blame it on gun violence and lack of gun control measures.](https://twitter.com/jimmyprinceton/status/785909143605501952)  ***"The terrorist watch list does not mean someone is a terrorist."***
/r/[Redacted] - T_D is homophobic and islamophobic for remembering the Pulse nightclub shooting, reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
This incident and the cover-up on Reddit is what opened my eyes. I'll never forget. 
R.I.P to the victims. My prayers and sincere condolences go out to the families still in pain from losing loved ones one year later. This was the night that ultimately began the process of flipping me into becoming a Trump supporter. Trump was the only leader to speak out against islamic Terrorism and not shy away due to PC nonsense. All the left (including reddit) did was try to censor the truth and guess what, it's still happening today. They still haven't learned their lesson and because of this, the left and reddit in general will continue to lose.
I think it's really great that with all the shit this sub gets about being a white supremacist​, homophobic, alt-right cult, we can still have simple discussions about topics that matter and not the idiotic splurge of the left on places like BuzzFeed and mtv. It's horrible that they covered this tragedy up. RIP
Liberals: Okay T_D, lets not politicize a mass killing by injecting politics into it even though the aspect of Radical Islam is 100% legitimate and the reason of the attack. Omar Mateen was on tape saying he is doing this for ISIS.  Also Liberals: Let us remember the pulse attack and do everything we can to limit the 2A. 
Wow I can't believe you're being so intolerant, just because muslims want to eradicate the jews and homosexuals and it's written in their holy book that comes directly from their God doesn't mean you can just blame them for violence they commit.
And CNN still will not report on the motive.
why do I still have friends that take it in the ass still marching for Islam? Milo!    
This was the reason I subscribed here. Open and civil discourse should never be silenced in favour of political correctness. 
10% downvoted.... wtf reddit?

Wow, 15k, even the "new and improved" algorithm(s) (that only affect this sub apparently) can't stop this. The real count is probably wayyyy higher when you take out Soros shills and reddit tampering.  Also, RIP to the victims of this senseless tragedy that occurred because of a radical Islamist.
I wanted to check if reddit did something to remember the attacks. As of posting, there ain't jack shit on the club shooting. Guess it ain't a 'priority' to em. Searching it brings me to the damned Donald Trump fanboy club. Thank y'all for showing support. I can't believe that there are people who actively seek to hurt folks like me for something as petty as liking guys.   Lol only thing I can find is negative Trump posts and video games. I guess I'm not the right demographic for this app. 😕 least F1 and NFL is popular on here. (Note: this comment was created about 10 minutes ago. Couldn't post due to a moment of silence)
I just want to live my life in peace, but muslims want to kill me because I'm attracted to guys instead of six year old girls.
I wish every day that we do not wind up cucked to the oppressive moon god like Europe has....
I think reddit seems to forget how much Donald truly cares for that community. 
Idiotic pictures of doggies and kitties, or any old stupid comment from a Trump-Hate sub are immediately bumped to the front page, meanwhile this tribute is censored. We're through the looking glass people, the truth has become politically incorrect. 
It's not "radical Islam". It's just normal Islam. Stop implying that it is radical or extremism like it's just an exception. Sharia Law is what the majority of the muslim population believes in and the Quran directly encourages terrorism. 
 When the shooting happened, I was on an annual camping trip with dad, brother, BIL and nephews. Happened the night we left. I came back home and stopped at the grocery store. Saw I believe it was a time magazine, that had pictures of all the victims on the front. My first thought was damn, all those guys look gay, but then thats the club scene, bunch of cucks. Then I came home and heard the news. I still feel guilty about judging all those gay men on that cover. Sorry guys.
The mainstream media refuses to admit it was Islamic terrorism that killed those people. Which, when you think about it, means the media refuses to honor them.
Came to pay my respects; Rest In Peace you fabulous crew. May we all share a cocktail to your memories. 🍹.... P.s shame on the r/rainbow homos for having a fucking angry hissyfit, defend the dead, not the attacker for fuck sakes. They give there rest of us fags a bad name. 
President-Elect Trump is calling for people to apply to Make America Great Again! Administration jobs usually are snapped up by donors or officials, but TRUMP wants to hire GOOD AMERICANS for these positions! Want to help? Send in your resume!
#https://www.greatagain.gov/serve-america.html  #https://www.greatagain.gov/news/help-wanted-4000-presidential-appointees.html  #https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012/pdf/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012.pdf   ##Centipedes, it's so important you apply and go if you can. I have had this conversation with so many people. **I know** lots of you make plenty of money in the private sector or that DC doesn't seem like the place to build a career. **I know** it would seem like a huge downgrade to many of you, and like a hindrance to many more of you just starting out.  ##Doesn't matter where you are in the career spectrum, I know that a lot of people look on DC/government jobs/the Swamp with suspicion and disdain. Rightly so. _But...._  ##**Please apply**. If you have to turn down an offer, so be it, but just consider it. We cannot let the Executive branch be flooded with cucks and hangers on and the bottom feeders of the Swamp that our God-Emperor's mighty trident doesn't have time to aim at. These are the enablers that gave people like Crooked Hillary power; they're the 'functionaries' the Davoisie count on to do and say the 'right' things for the 'right' people.   #They have to go back. We have to send them _OUT, OUT, OUT!_ 
> greatagain.gov   # HOLY KEK
Fucking fantastic man. Take us back to the founding of our country where being a politician wasn't a job. Politicians went back home and were farmers and blacksmiths, inventors and journalists. It was the fact that these people lived in these communities and had the same issues of the common men that let them truly speak for their municipalities. This will take us back to a greater time in this country. 
The feel when you can work for Trump 
I applied yesterday. It would be nice to get a position and help **MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!**
#PRESIDENT TRUMP, PLEASE MAKE HIRING COMPETITIVE AND TRANSPARENT LIKE ONE OF YOUR COMPANIES!

What's the average salary for a full-time shitposter?
#"The time commitment is significant and the pace is fast."  What a fucking boss in every sense of the word. 
Applied last week!
When he said he knew the best people, he meant he knew **the American people.**  *guys I'm not crying I promise*
I would apply but I already work full time for the Trump administration as a shit-posting The_Donald employee. I consider this a job I do for free. 
Man if US immigration was not so tough for European people I'd be on the first plane out from England to somewhere like texas or Arizona.  I have a degree, I speak English, I have a deep respect for America but your country seemingly would rather allow foreigners who hate you and can't speak your language. Very unfair!
I'm going to do it. Why not? Let's see what happens.
While I think I could do my part inside the house, I'll stay away so even greater Americans can apply and MAGA!  That, and I don't want to live in that hellhole DC lol

Holy shit the absolute madman is putting hardworking Americans back in charge. What a fucking ledge.

Nobody was talking about this pre-election, but this is fucking YUGE.  This is the benefit of electing a political outsider and a self-made man. These important positions will neither be bought nor gained through insider-deals. They will be given to those with best qualifications.  And it is amazing.
How do I put "creating and posting dank Trump memes" and "has really good ideas" down as applicable experience?
I'm a veteran with a STEM degree and a pretty good corporate track record.  Yet I applied because I want to be part of fixing VA once and for all.  Hope I get through :)
Wait wait wait, people who are skilled will get the job instead of people with connections?  My mind is blown.
# DRAINING THE SWAMP
[deleted]
does 100,000 karma from The_Donald count as experience? 
I applied. I am a janitor at a hospital currently. I'd rather janitor for you Mr. President.
Unfortunately I'm too lazy :(
Job Jobs Jobs folks! 
Wow. It's like actually allowing the people of the US to be in charge of the US.  Who would have ever thought to do that? ;)  
Go fuck yourself Barry, THIS is hope, THIS is change.
Resumes? Relevant experience? Being good at your job? Trump already changing the face of government.
Fuck it I'm 24 with a degree in political theory and I have experience interning for elected officials, campaigns, etc.   I'm applying.
I applied for Secretary of Shitposting, I hope i get the  job!
Ya know, I'm a liberal independent and I've been thinking about applying. If Trump is actually willing to surround himself with people who represent the entire country, than I am more comfortable in seeing what he will do in office, than if he surrounded himself with yes men or people already in his camp. I could lament about the whole "be the change you want to see in the world" thing, but honestly, if we are going to not have an insider as President, then we should actually embrace politics that aren't insider, and find common ground among the entire political spectrum where possible. 
I need a job so bad, I can't stop thinking about the bills. I have about around $575 due this month in residential heating oil, water/trash, and electric bill. Unemployment gives me $544.32 a month. It's non-stop on my mind and I'm in fear that I will soon be losing my place to live. Food stamps only gives me $48 a month because of the unemployment I've been claiming, so I have to really make that stretch by eating Ramen Noodles and canned food. I've also turned down my heat unless I really need it, so sometimes it is 60~65°F inside the house. The dog is Australian Shepard, so he doesn't seem to mind the cold much.      US navy veteran, great with computers, drug free, and broke. I'm definitely going to look into this, even though I have zero hope of getting employment. 😕 It's worth a try, right?      Edit: I can't relocate, but an hour and a half drive to work is within my ability. Currently living in Salisbury, MD. I dunno... Still worth applying. Maybe I'd relocate if I knew what the job was. 
I'm sending this to Dan Carlin. I want that man to work in our government. 
I already applied - I'm a recruiter, up vote if you want me to post a primer of good resume writing!
How can I serve? I would like to know more
Not in the oval office yet and Trump is already creating new jobs! **#MAGA**
I saw that the awesome based chick, Brunell Donald-Kyei applied.  I hope she gets an awesome job because she was slaying the enemy in the name of God Emperor Trump. 
I'm not qualified for any of this but would have no problem being an errand-runner or coffeemaker around the place. 
Posting these links when arguing with crying liberals is hilarious.  >Trump is bringing in people that is against climate change!  >here's a link to apple for a job working in Trump's administration, knock yourself out.  >OMG I WILL NEVER WORK WITH THAT RACIST(besides they will cut off my welfare if I found a real job)
What kind of positions are these? Aide-level? Or do those go later? 
Domain "greatagain.gov" was registered 10/26/16.    Makes you wonder what they knew and when...

Ron Paul for secretary of Treasury!
The administration is becoming a company with Donald as the employer? Interesting. I'm curious about the result.
**Calling all centipedes to drain the swamp! This train has no brakes!**
i applied, i am tesseract from neogaf. science advisory.
I wonder if they'll hire me to filter the applications because we know they're going to get hit by CTR and trolls.
I'm applying.  Finishing my degree on inauguration day.  Perfect.
Is there a place to see job descriptions/requirements?
Can't wait to have 4000 centipedes in official positions :)
What about Based Aussie Economists like myself?  I want to help with his PPP infrastructure program!  
I just applied, I doubt my resume is better than others or that I am more qualified, but if I'm able to help Make America Great Again, I will!
Still working on undergrad at 28. In no way am I qualified for this.
This is amazing.  Great job already Trump!
I wonder if he needs a new White House chef.   At least he knows I won't poison him. 
Mechanical engineer here, and hispanic to boot. I was a fervent Clinton supporter and volunteer, but I'm more than willing to give the man a chance.  I applied to be a structural engineer on the Mexican-American border.  Time to MAGA!
>Consideration is taken for possible conflicts of interest.  Yes, please don't hire SJW's.  There's way too many in govt positions already.
We are so blessed to have a President Elect like Mr. Donald Trump. This is the kind of thing that will MAGA.
I have applied!!!
[deleted]
I feel like applying for something """C Y B E R""" security related but I, like many security researchers, feel this exhaustive process to vet people probably will exclude me, lel
I already subitted my resume like 3 days ago. 
#START APPLYING, AMERICAN CENTIPEDES!
Done. He's probably getting a billion of these, but it's worth a shot.  After all, his candidacy was 1 in a billion. 
This reads more and more like a Tom Clancy novel.
Holy shit this is just like what Andrew Jackson did. THIS IS AWESOME
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED TO SEE! I've been a supporter since he announced he was running. Being a Trump supporter while go through college is no easy task. I faced daily mistreatment from friends, peers, and professors. And with the most recent results of the election and graduating in 34 days I want to leave the Midwest and join something I believe in. Thanks OP
I applied the other night when the site went live. I'm a disabled veteran and a mental health clinician at the VA. I'm able to experience the VA from both sides. I'm hopeful that my unique experience may be of service towards making American great again. 
I work heavily with veterans, I would give my life to be able to fight for them in Washington. I would not rest, I will not stop. I will find a solution that will be of benefit to those who have served us, and to protect their families. 
if anyone gets hired from here let us know!
24yo minority, BS in molecular biology, started up a public interest group, currently working on an MPH from a top tier school, would love to make America great again. What are my chances?
Applying would be a paycut, a move to a new city and maybe not a great career move.    That being said I will apply to MAGA.   
A nativist New Deal? 
Damn I applied before the weekend and was hoping this wouldn't get to the top and flood the applicant pool.   Having said that, with more applicants we have a better chance of picking the right people to MAGA
He just created 4000 jobs without a doubt before he was president.
I just applied to be Marijuana Czar.
Even Politifact can't disagree with the fact that Obama has prosecuted more whistleblowers than all the previous administrations combined. It would a shame if this somehow made it to /r/All despite the new "algorithm" to selectively filter The_Donald
I voted for Obama in 08 bc he promised government transparency, and protection for whistleblowers, and proceeded to do the exact opposite
However, they really tried their best to downplay it. Hard to argue with straight facts though.
The **"**Most Transparent**"** administration, folks!
Up up up!!!!  "Organically" a.k.a as usual from our high energy.
Wait... ELI5 please  If Obama used the Espionage Act to prosecute Whistleblowers who leaked info to JOURNALISTS. How about Killary, Pedo-desta, Sidney, Huma, et al who constantly leaked info to JOURNALISTS?  Or am I wrong?
This article doesn't even mention the amount of time served by these people. Bradley Manning alone is serving 35 years, more than anyone else combined I believe. http://www.pbs.org/newshour/spc/multimedia/espionage/
Don't forget he's bombing 7 countries in 8 years.  He's started more bombings than Bush.
[deleted]
President Trump, please promote a whistle-blower protection clause in the Espionage Act! Patriots should never be punished for heroism.
Obama also spied on journalists.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Department_of_Justice_investigations_of_reporters

Why the obsession with r/all? For real though, I'm all for Trump but every other post is about getting to r/all...? 
There's your Democratic savior, libs.  Btw, Fuck /u/spez.
When you jail whisteblowers for exposing corruption, brand opposing opinion as "hate speech" and have a biased MSM, you do not have a Democracy.   
Promises to run the most transparent administration ever  Prosecutes record number of whistleblowers  Thanks, Obama

This I can agree with being on r/all. Very good catch!

"Algorithm" = u/spez cuckoldry I think is what you meant. We are the BBC to his cuckold. 
I chose to hide that "Enough" subreddit... Ya know because they decided to upvote the face of a murderer to the front page.

I guess T_d can still make it to /r/all even after the rule changes.  They might not dominate r/all with their high power shit posting anymore, but they can still make it with natural voting.  
But $hillary's leaks were OK because they were just due to her stupidity.  And her $hitty server.  And her laziness and low energy.  And Weiner's wife.

I don't know if you know this or not, but everything that Reddit stood for in 2008 they are against now. They will literally be against job creation and anti-globalism for the next 8 years just because its Trump doing it. Shameful, really. 
Politifact said something anti-Democrat?? That's almost as rare as \r\politics saying something anti-Democrat!
For once I agree with you guys but this shouldn't be coming from t_d. All citizens regardless of political affiliation should be critical of their elected leaders. I'm no Trump fan but I'm not the biggest fan of Obama either.

EnoughTrumpSpam has an /all post at #3 where they declare our Rule VI [No Dissenters/SJWs, this is a pro-Trump subreddit] is somehow the same as censoring The_Donald from /all.  This is simply bad logic.  So I have to ask, why is supporting the US president considered DISSENT?  Why is it called /ALL?  And why is it acceptable to have rules that only apply to SOME?

DO IT
See, this is an r/The_Donald post that I certainly don't mind, isn't spam, and should engender conversation about a very valid criticism of a political figure. 
So, now we trust politifact?
Derp, but no, drep, Obama is cool and everything. I saw him on Between Two Ferns. He's really in touch with the youth. He wouldn't actually be a massive authoritarian who  cracked massively down on whistleblowers? And that minor thing where the IRS were cracking down on political groups opposed to Obama, that was just a mistake... Right? Derp.
Fuck this stupid libtard site.
reddit then: "net neutrality and free speech are important!  we cant let people mess with our internet!"  reddit now: "censor this, I dont like it!  who cares that people messed with their posts!"  its interesting how attitudes change depending on how people feel, isnt it?  then: obama, nobel peace prize winner  now: obama, saudi arabia billion dollar arms salesman  peace prize winner selling a country of savages weapons...a nation with clear ties to terrorism.  you're really earning that nobel prize, mr obama!
Fire your upvote cannons, Centipedes! FIREEEEE!

Sadly not seeing a single td post in r all now 
Let's enhance the diversity of different types of discussions that a user can experience on Reddit by actively assisting them in filtering out subreddit's that have opposing viewpoints because counterarguments are scary.
The fact that I had to scroll down to see this post on all really pisses me off. I hate this fucking site. I can't even try tolerate liberals anymore
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE   OBAMAS A GREAT PRESIDENT! HE LEGALIZED GAY MARRIAGE!!!!!!!     RTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This is no news. This is one of the things, he's widely criticized for. Has been discussed a lot on reddit, and everywhere. 
I understand that these leaks can cause damage to America and it's a complicated topic; however maybe we should examine WHY there are so many leaks occurring.  
http://pastebin.com/yvxa9Lrs
See, therd ya go. Useful information. Not bullshit. Good R_TD
He ALSO was the best damned gun merchant in history, not only the panic buys here after false-flags, but to all those "rebels" he armed (more than any other POTUS)
Pretty much all of reddit is aware of this, and we all agree that it's shitty.

Obama Promised but Wikileaks Delivered.
If you like your doctor...
We need to drain this swamp!
"Scandal-free" administration isn't so hard when you burn everyone who isn't covering your ass.
It takes a lot, but as you now know, you have to learn to look past the rhetoric and think about the fundamentals of what people are saying;  In my experience anyone looking to expand the size of Government and its influence on citizens affairs, **is not** going to also foster a culture of Govt transparency and protecting whistle-blowers.  Quite the opposite in fact, they want to continue their agenda without annoying things like accountability and transparency slowing them down....  I don't think you can name a country where the Govt was increased to near totalitarian levels while simultaneously becoming more transparent and less corrupt.  It simply **does-not-happen.**    
Same
Most transparent(ly evil) administration in history!
Same here, did not vote for him in 2012, voted libertarian.  Voted Trump this time.
He also promised to get a handle on unaccountable foreign policy, yet only months after taking the presidency he expanded the drone program and ignored addressing extraordinary rentition altogether.

Me too. 
Having deja vu yet?
[removed]
Most bias consists not in presenting false facts, but in presenting facts falsely.  To anyone aware of the situation, it is obvious that Politifact sympathizes heavily Democrat. They emphasize Republican failings and downplay those of the Dems.
It's also a fact that Obama Governed in an era where technology made it easier to leak matrtial. So there was more potential whistle-blowers to prosecute. 
[deleted]
Well, it was. Thanks to Wikileaks
I'm pretty sure this points more to Hillary giving classified info to her friend Sydney Blumenthal for personal financial use. You could also look into the documents that Blumenthal returned to her that were strikingly similar to CIA internal research documents.  But yes, giving info to the media was also bad.
Interesting, we should do some digging and figure that out.  Maybe shoot the question to gowdy, hannity, Carlson ?

What stops them from cheering for Wikipedia censorsing?  Then what would stop them for a fucking book burning?  No matter what you think of this sub... They didn't go down the deep dark path of trying to shut down opposed views & users. This is why the logical extreme of Marxism theory leads to a shallow ditch with firing squad.
I've never seen so many downvotes on comments in any post on this sub and I've been around since it was a month or so old.   Like, goddamn. They changed the algorithm, threatened to ban the sub, changed the sticky policy only for us and allowed non-RES/gold users to filter this sub.   But, that's not enough. Let's go to their sub and downvote comments with +1 or +2. That will show them.   **Cucks. Get this through your heads. Trump is your president. Nothing you can do will change that. Conservatives control all three branches of government. There was a referendum on liberal policy and liberal policy was ass blasted and blown the fuck out from sea to shining sea.

What the fuck is the point of r/all if it's filtered (censored) ???  I clicked sub to the_donald today, fuck these shits who try to censor online communities
It's these kind of posts that have gotten us quarantined. You guys are toxic /s
Companies leaving for Mexico are flocking to negotiate with him, every time a liberal shill tries to show a conflict of interest he is one step ahead (he's giving up his empire!), investors are seeing green, we're looking at big federal income tax cuts, opportunities for small business to start up and be profitable without going under from hikes in obamacare, he is still shitting all over the media and isn't going to take their BS during his presidency and they're freaked the fuck out...  And he isn't even sworn into office yet. Get ready for a wild ride guys and gals!
God damn you are all cancer. 
The only people who got triggered by t_d hitting the front page of /all have more than likely filtered it out by now anyway. So... t_d's target audience is for shitposting is now gone. I don't really see what's being accomplished anymore.
I agree
But doesn't this movement just claim that all r/The_Donald posts should be treated as shitposts?  Perhaps getting to the front page in a more respectable manner would be more advisable.  He's already been elected so I guess it doesn't matter... I'm just curious to the logic behind this movement.  Seems more childish than anything.  Site note: I voted for Trump if that minimizes my downvotes.

Whether or not you like R/donald we should treat R/donald people as equals.. If there is a problem, its not just people from R/donald.

GOOD ONE!
*Puts lips to microphone* WRONG!
I love how Reddit celebrates suppression of free speech after all the concerns for free speech they had about flag burning. 
THE WALL JUST GOT 10 FEET HIGHER BELIEVE ME.
It's 1 am and we have +21,000 members on here. HIGH. ENERGY.
It's pretty hilarious they can't let the word all actually be it's definition. All * Except that which isn't allowed.
I just upvoted the first two pages of this glorious subreddit, you can't stop 312 379 russian bots and still rising you fools. Can't stop, won't stop until Mother Russia totally own your sorry leftist asses, suckers! The God-Emperor is bringing back jobs for the proletariat! What the fuck is wrong with those fools? 
ENERGY
The shitposts must go on!
Why didn't he just delete the sub entirely? What's his angle? 
Is Spez becoming Frank "Grimey" Grimes from the Simpsons?
That's bull shit!
Oh no no, you got it all wrong. It's not that he wants to stop the sub from making it to r/all. It's that people should be able to choose not to see that shitposting. And he's right about that.   And now people can choose not to see any of it. Spez is actually right about that (not sure if you wanna accept that or not). 
That worked well
Maybe if you stop shitposting there wont be such an issue?
How is there 7,300 votes with only 40 comments? Isn't that ratio weird?
[removed]
Well you can filter now.
How do I block this fat bitch? Using BaconReader on iOS. 
Someone make /r/the_donald2 and shitpost right past their filters!

k, bruh, can't listen, I filtered ya.

# Super Bigly Wrong!
There are no brakes on the /r/the_donald train 
Just sticky a link to the actual post and lock it.
If thinking that is wrong is wrong, then I don't want to be right!
WEW
*wrong*
We need to come up with a plan to shitpost onto r/all though. Create a new sub?
big league 
That's really all it comes down too
The official portrait of our president should be every single post on the front page.
Yes. This is the response. Thank God for the Reddit mods and admins who continue to truly inspire the passionate t_d users. They must really love us to amuse us so much.

Yikes just saw it, I wouldn't expect anything less the day before inauguration... Butthurt Reddit.
Paul Joseph Watson: "The media is freaking out because Trump spoke to a democratically elected leader, and this might offend a dictatorship. Let that sink in."
The fuck is China going to do, refuse to make our shit and force us to reopen factories in the USA?
The media a joke. It's no wonder that they are failing bigly. 
Yeah and they cried when a brutal communist dictator died, yet call everyone that disagrees with them nazis.   Let that sink in.
The President of Taiwan is also a woman... had Trump declined her call the media would probably be calling him a sexist right now.
Obama meets with Castro and the press acts like its V-E day. Trump takes a call from a democratically elected leader and its the cuban missile crisis.
[removed]
[deleted]
Fucking PJW nails it every time.
I bet a lot of liberals are having a crisis right now considering Trump has already done a better job of being President than the actual President.
Watson makes a great point here.  Further shows how subversive MSM is today and their ultimate goal of breaking down American values.  Was eating lunch out yesterday, and bar area had MSNBC on.  They had a field reporter out in Monterey, Mexico actually deriding the Carrier deal because of the negative financial impact it may have on area Mexican workers.  She also went into detail about how angry local politicians were and how they ordered Mexicans to stop crossing the border to shop at U.S. stores.  Why does the MSM & the left hate America and American working families so much?  Is's very sad.
People seem to be getting offended on behalf to prove how much they know about diplomacy.   Its almost as if they have nothing else to brag about.
Jesus it's hard to keep the liberal agenda straight, first we hate fascists but love Castro, then we hate Putin (fascist) again, then we hate Taiwan but love China.  FFS, maybe people don't vote for your party because you can't make up your mind on policy issues. 
[deleted]
The media are just revealing their misogyny. They would have no problem with this if the president of Taiwan were a man, but since it's a woman the media is full of misogynistic hatred. 
This whole situation feels backwards, it feels like people are either 100% for Trump or 100% against him. There's no middle ground, what the hell? 
Not just a democratically elected leader. A democratically elected leader from the progressive liberal party of their government. Also a woman. Also a minority (because anyone is a minority if they aren't white, even if they're the ethnic majority in their country).
I hope he calls up Iran's supreme fuckwad next and tells them the nuclear deal is off.
TAIWAN NUMBA ONE!! 
He also saved 1000 jobs and this apparently doesn't sit well with the American media.    Let that sink in.   
I'm a Taiwanese American and hate the communist Chinese (only the government, not Chinese people). Reading / listening to libtards freaking out over Trump taking a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan's President is both hilarious and disgusting at the same time.  China's government has been bullying Taiwan for many decades. They've also recently bullied the U.S. due to Obama's ineptitude and willingness to allow every country to step all over America.   Where was the left's outrage when [China sent 5 ships to the coast of Alaska when Obama visited](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/chinese-naval-ships-alaska-obama-visit-article-1.2347041) or how about when [they embarrassed the U.S. and Obama when he visited China for G20 this year](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/barack-obama-deliberately-snubbed-by-chinese-in-chaotic-arrival-at-g20)? But we're supposed to be outraged at a phone call between Trump and Taiwan's President? Absolutely ridiculous, considering Trump isn't even President yet and China has already destroyed any diplomatic relations with our sitting President multiple times.  China doesn't respect the U.S. and we shouldn't respect them either. In fact, China has been saber rattling for years against the U.S. and the Pacific region. They've been bullying Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and everybody else in Asia. China is a belligerent piece of shit dictatorship that has a history of countless human rights violations. Not to mention how Mao and his commies executed, killed, tortured, jailed, and starved to death over 70 million Chinese to take control and keep their power. That's way over 10 times the amount of deaths Hitler caused. Let THAT sink in!
Funny thing is that Trumps discussion ware entirely appropriate. He is not, right now, an Official US foreign diplomat. Anyone freaking out is just using it as an excuse to keep coming up with things to attack him. I do like it though that he did call bullshit on the one china doctrine.
Obama made sure we gave booty calls to China Everytime they cat-called. It's time for change.
what happened again?
Trump will have good relations with almost EVERY country including China and Russia because he will be a deal maker for good NOT evil like Obama and Hillary. Thanks to Wikileaks we now know that they were in it for the Globalism and as Communist as China and Russia ARE, they still like their Sovrienty. The European and Globalization of the rest of us was what Soros wants to go to war with Russia and China... Trump and Brexit are to break that up. Our only other hope is that Le Pen wins, Merkel falls and Italy leaves etc. this is why Putin warned that if Hilary wins its WW3
I bet whenever Xi Jinping picks up the phone to talk to someone who's on the US shit-list he gives it a second thought. (He doesn't.)  Let alone how many Chinese reporters would end up in "re-education facilities" if they voiced the same concerns that our press is voicing about Trump's phone call.  Don't get me wrong, the press is free to voice their concerns all they want, but it's a whole different situation in China...
They'll try to get Trump for literally anything, and they have the MSM on their side. 
The media are a bunch of liberals. The liberals lost the election.  The liberals have proven themselves to have the collective logical acumen of a 5 year old.          **Let that Sink in**     
LITERALLY FUCKING HITLER
Try commenting in r/worldnews their heads are exploding. 
DONT WE LOVE OUR ORGANIC R/ALL POSTS FOLKS?!
Member when liberals were pushing the "Free Tibet" campaign, against the same dictatorship?
Well said!!!
The media does not support democracy or a republic. The people who control the media want a global dictatorship. 
I hope Trump now meets with the Dalai Lama and really rubs it in. MAGA Namaste. 
Based PJW
So who exactly is Paul J Watson because he's consistently BASED AS FUCK! It must be the J middle initial
Communist dictators are different!  **Reeeeeeee!**
Just shows how cucked people are that their so offended by what China might think. Really?
It's actually fucking amazing.  America, land of the free, democracy an all that, but FUCK YOU if you DARE answer a phone call from another democratic leader because a commy regime that has threatened them with missile strikes if they dare think about independence would get mad.  Trump is more in tune with american beliefs than you think.
"oh no, we might offend china, the people who think tiananmen square didnt happen!"  -idiot liberal logic  well come on guys, you are the ones allegedly about tolerance: why dont you think taiwan deserve to be acknowledged as a nation?
 Hey /u/thunderbert80,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
The media is going to freak out no matter what.  They've been doing it ever since the primaries.  This is funny, because there were two Democrats running for President this time around, so Democratic voters got their pick.    So who's upset?  Could it be the people who think Trump will interfere with their gravy train?
This world has lost its god damned mind
CHina isn't going to war with NATO, NATO as a whole spends about 20x what China does in military tech.  Not only that but their economy would fall apart immediately with all their trade partners at war with them.  
I'm a Taiwanese immigrant. China has bullied Taiwan for so long. To see the God emperor stand up for little Taiwan so brazenly and unapologetically brought tears to my eyes.
'member when liberals used to say America should set an example for the rest of the world and not walk on eggshells for dictatorships that don't even like us?  Does this mean we should also start ass kissing the Saudis again? That would be the extension of the logic. Oh and we're already meddling with regime change in yet another Middle Eastern country.  2016, the year every liberal inadvertently became a 2003 neocon simply out of spite.   Such a bankrupt ideology. top kek tho  
I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw articles about this!  MSM is siding with a Communist dictatorship over a freely democratic country with a free press & free market!     So basically nothing new!
Remember guys, the only way to fix something that's broken is to keep doing the same thing over and over again (it's not). 
They didnt freak out when obama antagonized them for the last 4 years in the china sea
The MSM LOVES it's Communist dictators.
Obama restores relations with a communist Cuba but the media says nothing, sad! 
Fuck China.  But fuck the US media even harder.  
They will discredit Trump every step of the way. Every single thing he has done is spun into a pessimistic blabber. 
I bought whole sale gloves for my medical practice from China. They were suppose to be letex and nitral gloves. Which. Usally from USA are like $12 a box. From whole sale in China they were cheap. But I started notice the material did not feel letex of nitral. Plus whole staff complained that gloves are giving them rash. I sent one glove to a lab in nj and they said gloves are made of not letex but some heap cheap material which is banned in USA. I was so shocked. I told the China rep. She said use them to clean toilet cause u are not getting money back 
Anyone else think he overuses "let that sink in"?
We must confront the radical alt-left wherever they raise their ugly heads. The overthrow of the totalitarian, one-party Communist regimes in Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, North Korea and China are long overdue.  China is particularly interesting as there are natural bridgeheads for destabilising and formenting civil unrest in Hong Kong, Tibet and Taiwan. The funding of opposition parties for Independence in these countries would provoke a predictable reaction from the regime in Beijing which would be the spark that sets off a civil war that we can fund and support.   
But think of the horrible diplomatic repercussions: that dictatorship might stop selling us its shit. 
Trump is going to stand up to China. That is why he likes Romney. Merry Christmas, and may God bless us, every one. 
TRUMP IS FIGHTING THE METEOR
America, fuck ya!
#CHYNA....YOU ARE ON NOTICE MOTHERFUCKERS!!  We will not concede to your bullshit anymore.  
Exactly
Trump is going to do what he wants. He won't listen to the cucks in the media about what rules to play by. 
Imagine that? Liberals defending communist China. Why am I not surprised??
The left is scared of its own shadow at this point. Any nation that might look at us funny causes them to cower.
I never understood this whole offending China meme.  Didn't the US president and trade delegation just waste more than two years of **secret meetings** trying to encircle China economically by creating a trade bloc without them (the TPP)?
So now we can't answer the phone? Honest question, Liberals.
r/politics is all butt hurt saying it's a scam for trump to open hotels and he is abusing power.  There is even articles with no sources that say that's what the  call was about.  I agree with top comment though,  what's China gonna do?  
We are in a place where everything - yes everything Trump does will be pilloried by the MSM.   That means they plan to fight tooth and nail to prevent improving American lives.   Let that sink in too. 
What they still don't understand:  We elected Trump because the current system - that the last 4 presidents have made the "new normal" (Bush/Clinton/Bush/Obama [paid for by the people that brought you Clinton], and what was supposed to be a Clinton vs Bush election this year) is **deeply broken**.  Ya know what the absolute worst argument to make against someone who voted to upend a system is? "It's the way we've always done it!"  Maybe a 35 year old policy **needs** to be changed, or at least brought into question.

China is building a military fortress in the South China Sea.  Also, it might be a bit butthurt over the loss of some of its manufacturing jobs.  Forget about ISIS, China might be the real problem.
China isnt really a dictatorship you dont need to say that... after all Trump talking to Taiwan isnt going to do jack shit in any direction, other then stupid MSM reporting on this unimportant distraction.
**THIS IS ON THE TOP OF r/all! LETS KEEP IT THERE!**
When EU and America supported the coup to bring down Ukraine's democratically elected leader since he was pro-Russian, I questioned the left's view of voters.       
This is pretty much how I feel about the election reaction, and all this "precedent", and "this is how it's always been done" stuff.  Especially with foreign affairs it seems.   https://youtu.be/TLzhlsEFcVQ?t=3m
I can't wait to see what the libcucks and the media have to say when he starts calling out our "fake allies" like China and Turkey. They might implode when he recognizes the Armenian Genocide 
Remember when the MSM cursed Obama for opening relations with Cuba while they were still a brutal dictatorship.  Me either. 
Something about a business deal call preceding his phone call?
"I just come here for the upvotes" - Centipedes

I truly believe he is trying to unmask the medias' failings to the people of our country. Over and over he exposes their bias and lack of journalistic integrity. It will be easier to "drain the swamp" when most people are aware of the pollution.
THE METEOR
What a week for lefty dictator love fests  https://i.sli.mg/FaSCKn.jpg
I said this yesterday but this is nothing more than a powermove to put China back in check. China and Russia were getting very close while the EU has basically collapsed as a block of power and the US under Obama lost any form of credibility. Trump is now getting closer with Russia like Nixon did with China back when we were putting the Russians back in check. Plus a pivot to Russia basically ends any talks of Cold War v2.                                          In other words, liberals are going to claim the sky is falling with every Trump action and continue to look like idiots for the next 8 years.                                                                                                                               Why do you think he talked with Duerte and basically told him good job on the drug war or called Pakistan? He's solidifying his powerbase in the East ensuring that China can't get uppity and basically threatened to call Taiwan a sovereign nation with this phone call. Trump has been railing against China all along and he's now implementing his plan.
So ambivalent on PJW. He says really smart things like this, but also says stupid things.
Still taking the top of all with all the extra censorship on this sub.
I see your true colors shining through 
I have a sincere question for any member of this sub willing to answer. I truly am not trolling or anything, so I hope its not mistaken for that. If this isn't the right place to ask or offer a differing viewpoint, please let me know which sub is more  appropriate. anywho...  As someone who considers themselves politically neutral, there has been many things Trump has said or done that, regardless of my support for some of his policies, feels almost inarguably offensive or, at the very least, concerning for a soon-to-be president to say publicly.  With that said, my question to you is: What would our president-elect have to say, do, or not do (i.e not keeping one of his campaign  promises) for you to unendorse or withdrawal your support for him?    From  an outsider's perspective, it seems as though there is virtually nothing he could do or say that you guys wouldn't unequivocally agree with, solely because it was he who said it.  Again, this comes from a honest curiosity and in no way am I trying to offend or troll the members of this sub.

The west has been using China as our sweat shops and to get round environmental damage in our countries. Pity they're to fucking stupid to see it.
Not like there's a shortage of up and coming third world countries that would jump at a chance to be industrialized.
Exactly, they have no leverage.  We could pay the interest on their bonds to a fund we hold for the 'people' of China to rebuild them after the fall of Communism.  Me, I'd flat out extort them.  $1 Trillion per year to continue the 1 China policy.  2 China's for free.  Bribing our worthless politicians does not make you an ally of the American people who are now back in charge.  Fuck \#FakeAllies like China, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.  Those are enemy 1, 2, and 3.  Even bigger enemies than ISIS or AQ.
MFW an Islamic Somali refugee terrorist was here for 2 years and attended Ohio State University and I work 40+ hours a week for an American company and could never dream to afford state college.
YYYEEEEEEEPPPPPP. yep. It has been like this for years. My son is 16 and my husband works his @$$ off, and we have no idea how we will pay for college. I actually had a conversation with the financial aid department at a college and they basically said, "yes if you are wealthy or poor you can come here. If you are middle class we have found the "system" (financial aid, etc.) doesn't work for you unfortunately."

WTF" racists for saying WTF about it all....  this is how you get Trump winning.  And the left is convinced it something nominal that they missed...they they didnt do a good job of conveying their policies to middle america....we fucking know your policies left thats why we didnt vote for you this time...we did the whole "had to have first black president" and we helped you do it but it didnt work out with policy...so fuck you.

There should not be one American tax dollar spent on scholarships, loans, or grants for foreigners attending American universities.
I was in Canada a few years ago and there were *working Canadian men* living in a shelter.. i repeat.. *working* and many at shitty difficult job... living in shelters with druggies and other suicidal working Canadians and no exaggeration across the street, seen from the window were a row of houses where social services arranged and paid for Muslim refugees to have rent paid, electricity bills and not a day went buy without some charity or government social workers showing up with something.   That is just straight up disgusting, its treasonous, wrong and whoever is doing this to people needs to be found, fired and stopped. 
This is why Trump won. America FIRST!! That stupid mother fucker Obama cares more about 3rd world refugees than his own citizens. 
I went to college mostly on loans, with a tiny bit of scholarships.  Got a real degree (Computer Science) then a master's (Computer Science), loans payed off....profit????
What have you become the greatest nation on earth... don't worry Trump will fix this!
Landscaper working usually 80hrs here. I feel ya brother, for sure. But soon things will change my friend!
It's ok, you don't need the liberal arts degree anyway. Tax cuts incoming on business.
please somebody send this valuable post to God Emperors team this shit has to end NOW
Oh, I thought they said that immigrants don't take opportunities from Americans. There are also illegals that help in raising the cost of college insurance and housing. I bet your pay is also lower due to cheap illegal labor.
I have felt the same way.   I was completely on my own at 18, with literally zero support from my parents, and I couldn't even qualify for Federal grants because Fafsa required I included my parents information for many years.  Which they are divorced, live in different states, and only made a combined 60K.  So I spent years working.  I did start college once I didn't have to use my parents information, but apparently making only 20K was too much money, so I could only qualify for loans.  Of course I still needed to survive, so I couldn't even go to school full time.  Eventually I realized, I would be in school forever taking only 6-8 credits at semester, barely surviving.  So I decided to take a break and just absolutely focus on my career the best that I could without school.  After more years I was able to work my way up to making almost 40K a year.  But eventually I realized with what I want to do, and where I want to go, it would be impossible without a degree or more knowledge. So I scrimped and saved and was able to return to school.  Part of last year I was able to go to school full time and work part time, and for about the last 9 months I have been in school in overdrive (more than full time to try and catch up.)  But it would not be possible without the years I worked beforehand.  Next semester I will likely not be able to continue going to school without working, so I will need to reduce my hours, but I only have about 40 more credits left, so there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  I am already over the age of 30.  Meanwhile, my sister when she moved out at 18 had a boyfriend pay for her rent completely while she worked 10 hours a week for spending money, and she qualified for pell grants because she was a woman, and graduated with a Bachelors in 4 years, and has been in her career for about the last 10 years.  And they say being a white male is a privilege. 
He tried to open up some spots for you. Religion of peace extending its good will.

I understand exactly how OP feels. I am 48 years old. Right out of high school I had to begin working full time (at a low paying job) because my parents did not have enough money for me to attend college (not even local community college). But I never complained because we were raised differently back then. No safe spaces. If something bothered you, tough! You had to suck it up.  From 1989 - 1996, I worked 60 hours a week (1 full time job, 1 part-time job) just to make ends meet.  Again, I never complained. I was raised knowing that if you wanted something, then you had to work hard to get it.  My husband, who is 63, was raised the same way.  Although he was fortunate in that his parents could pay for his college. Still, my husband worked his ass of starting his own company. Owned it for 30+ years and just sold it (and retired) last year.  It makes me angry that refugees and ILLEGAL immigrants get so much "free stuff" when they come to America.  No, I'm not saying I want to get free stuff. I don't. But I want our Veterans, our mentally disabled, and our homeless taken care of BEFORE we help strangers.
Its fucking bullshit. 
Meanwhile, immigrants like me have to wait years and go through an arduous expensive process to get into the United States legally. And then I'm gonna have to work really hard for a living and be able to pay for the more arduous and expensive process of trying to be certified RN. I could've gotten on a cruise ship and jumped ship and entered illegally so i could get welfare and free education, BUT I REFUSE TO BE A CRIMINAL and ruin my chances to be a citizen of the United States of America.
Damn, thats so unfair, is happening everywhere in the western world. Funding muslims university studies while hard working americans cannot afford them and will never do.
Retarded leftist policies are driving this country to down, and it's no wonder why they can't figured out why the lost the election. So when Trump says America First they're clueless why it resonates with middle America. We are taking our country back folks!
Have an upvote friend.   I worked 40 hours a week and went to a community college that I paid for to get my AA. Transferred to a 4 year school and went part time to finish my BA while doing an unpaid internship so that I had my foot in the door somewhere when I completed my degree (no AA hire for me). Guess that's what I get for fucking being a white male.   Now I work full time with no student loan debt so I can pay taxes for people who hate our country to go to privileged expensive state colleges. 
Same here in Sweden, lots of refugees get free housing in the downtown area, free food and public transport, free education for their children, free healthcare, and some "spending money" around 600 USD as a bonus, this sum can be higher if they have more than 2 children (which many of them have).   Meanwhile I'm working almost full time and studying full time in university and struggling to get by because I still have to pay rent, food and textbooks even if tuition is "free".   Of course, the only way we can pay for this luxury for the refugees is because of excessive taxes. Someone making minimum wage (around 1500 USD/month) pays 33% in taxes + 25% VAT on general stuff. High income earners pay a marginal tax of 60% over 60k USD/year.   
Migrants get all the benefits due to liberals.
Pisses me off to watch my straight A nephew work his ass off just to get by and maybe attend community college while these fuckers get a free ride to everything. 
This is really sad. I believe the US Government, after January 20th, will care for the people within it's own country. 
How the Democrats stay in power:  1. Sanctuary cities for illegals to vote 2. No improvements or gentrification of inner cities to secure black voters (literally slavery in modern times) 3. Generate racial divisive rhetoric and project the racism on the Republicans 4. Gain control of the legal system, finance system, Hollywood, and MSM  Liberals need to wake the fuck up.
OP, start upgrading your dream.  
We take care of everyone but our own. It is just sad. :( 
Cutest saddest Pepe. Play their game. Write a sob story on your application essay and check minority background like say american indian
What kind of party would do this to working-class Americans?  The DNC.  
Right there with you brother. Was working three jobs trying to keep shit together, and still couldn't even afford to go to school. Got fired from one after another and now can't even manage to find a job, and the college money's all gone into trying to pay for medical bills/insurgence. We need to MAGA.
Have you considered not being white?  
I worked my way through college, things like this and those fucking dreamers piss me off. 
You need to work on your refugee game.
NOTE: Im not from the US.  But man, I dont even mind that your country extended a hand, and gave a chance for him to improve himself, because thats the truth -- you never know whats to gain from other, distant lands, until you give a chance to them, its the globalist dream, people helping each other, la la la, be good and charitable and etc...  I mind that he thanked his hosts with 9 kills and a stabbing.
Honestly I'm beginning to become disgusted by how we treat immigrants compared to our own citizens. Every day that passes I become more and more isolationist. It's time we work to end the suffering at home.
Honestly, you'll get revenge when you get to watch the American collegiate system deteriorate before your eyes.   My brother summed it up perfectly when he explained how the liability that employers are now being forced to take on is surpassing the value provided by hiring individuals that have been indoctrinated into insane victim culture and "progressivism" (In quotes because I can't think of any movement more regressive that one that has actually been responsible for shit like encouraging black students to push for segregation).   I'm calling it now and you are all free to screenshot this for keks in the future, but, in maybe as little as 8-10 years, a degree from one of these echo chambers of liberal insanity will not only become worthless, but will change from a pro to a complete con in the eyes of employers around the country. 
Similarly to how illegal aliens in CA  can apply for aid and are charged in state tuition, while American citizens from out of State have to pay more.
I cant flawlessly align with all your political opinions but legit what the fuck. Why is college structured this way. It's either your poor, and they make it easy to pay for, or rich, and it doesn't fucking matter how much it is. The hard workers, that don't get any relief is just wrong.
OP has a pretty good point. Must be real nice to be a terrorist with a free ride. What a sweet life. I should stop working and start freeloading instead like these refugee guys.

As a black liberal professor, most of this arguments in this thread are spot on. The collegiate education system is a nightmare of a bureaucratic quagmire that makes "draining the DC Swamp" pale in comparison. Calm down with the race memes though...
And the left wonders why they're being voted out of office.      I joined the damn Army to even have a dream of one day going to college.      That was 20 years ago.  With universities being what they are nowadays, I don't even want to go and be forced to put up with that SJW bullshit.    I'd probably just wind up curbstomping a large portion of the university's population.      "What did you learn in college?"      "How to properly curbstomp SJWs."
I know really smart people that grew up poor that could never dream of making it to college. 
#D I V E R S I T Y
How dare you destroy his poor refugee's DREAM!😶😶😶😶😶😶Selfish American 😂
White, middle-class, straight person here...went to a private school so got almost no government help, finished university in 3 years, and will be paying off my loans until I die. Even though I have a good job, I've pretty much accepted the fact that I will never be able to also make payments on a new car or a house. It's almost overwhelmingly depressing sometimes.
I never thought of this when the event occurred. That is so fucked up and really bothers me. We treat these scumbags like VIPs showering them with all sorts of free things at the taxpayer's expense.   I was fortunate to have my education provided for, but I realize the pain of the extreme debt burden or just not having the opportunity to go. I would gladly pay my share in taxes to support fellow, non-Islamic terrorist, American citizens with the opportunity to go to college. These terrorists or an other non-citizen should never take priority. America comes first.
Kek, back in 2012 I applied to 5 universities in the US for Postgrad education. Was rejected for all 5 applications. I'll admit, I wasnt exemplary in my undergrad grades, i even had an average GRE score. But I met all requirements and was even ready to pay full tuition because I have the means to do so.  Oh well.
Imagine the amount of money we spend on people like this. Just think of the good we can do if we put that money to benefit Americans.
Dont you see? You're a racist fucking white male.
Ugh I hate upvoting something in this sub, but I can't disagree with you. My university won't pay me to work in a lab because I'm not a minority, I have to "volunteer" when all the other lab assistants are Hispanic or Native American and make 20 bucks an hour. 
That is fucked up. Lib fucks will say oh he's smarter/hard working and that gets me even more pissed. If they are so fucking smart and hard working then stay in your own country and figure it the fuck out.
Although I may sympathize with the plight of the OP, I have come here to say that the problem is not that of the system the seems to favor as in this case, the Somali immigrant, but rather the blame rests squarely on the shoulders of those, whomever they may be, that over several decades allowed an educational system evolve that makes higher education a terrible burden upon our young people and middle class families. 
I went to a trade school full time and worked full time. I slept 3 hours at night and 2 in the evening before work where I was paid $3.45 an hour as a waiter... tips were nice but, as a male waiter I ALWAYS received less tips than my female co workers despite having higher discipline and professionalism. My average tip out was $40.00 - $60.00 but, it was not a secure income. One Easter I made $130.00 in tips working the morning and night shift. I was emotionally overwhelmed. (this was 2007-2008). I was always poor. Food was stretched thin. No cable, no internet, just an empty apartment and a mattress. It can be done but, at what cost? Take out a living expense loan? Pay it off for 6-10 years? I guess there are options available. It all depends on how bad you want it. I lost 40 lbs from the start of school till graduation day. I'm 6' tall and normally weigh 160 lbs. My weight loss was from lack of proper diet. I graduated though. I'm a self employed Automotive Technician in a small town now. Long story short. Anything is possible if you put your mind to it. Not that it matters but, I'm a white millenial male from Oregon. Born in Portland... shame.. I know. 
Add the Dreamers to this as well, it's sickening.
White male from middle class house. Lots of loans is how I'm paying for my degree. I've been denied many many scholarships because I'm a white male, in engineering. But every other classmate is Indian and I guarantee they aren't paying a cent.
It's not just paying for college, getting in is hard if you are Asian or a white male. The system is fucked up and geared towards fucking over those who work hard in favor of identity politics
Ok I'm usually the last person to agree with r/The_Donald, but even in EU with all that free college, *we still have foreigners pay for it*. I'll never comprehend this country.
Heard the latest on the secret deal Obama made with the Aussies to take a few thousand of the refugees from the Middle East that they don't want? That's one of those BAD DEALS Trump was talking about. There's a reason Australia doesn't want them. They're smart. Obama's continuing cultivation of future dem voters, and absolutely free will be their entire means of healthcare, food, housing, transportation and the best education... OUR TAXES CAN BUY. Fuck Obozo. Trump will stop this shit in its tracks.
This pisses me off so bad. We should have Lower cost to go to College just like the generations before us but for some reason we live in an age where shit is crazy expensive and Somali immigrants get college education for free.
Fuck college. It's the breeding ground for Marxist ideologies. Just go learn a trade or craft. 
I feel you my man. I went to college for a year and walked out with $10k in debt. 
Yes--they are sayingthat the refugees that Obama is bringing in will qualify for more money that what even citizens could get it they maxed out in benefits.....they have set it up for them.....and the Dems continue to wonder why they lost.
Hey buddy, it might seem helpless now, but tbh schools, especially state schools are very good at helping out citizens too.  I went to a state school without paying a penny of tuition, took out loans to cover housing and food, and worked throughout to afford the rest. My brother and sister are too now.  If you're going for engineering, like I did, you can get internships later on worth 15, 20 or even 30 an hour during the summers and exit with no loans.  I know it's intimidating to see the published rates, but it's really not that hard to get your innstste tuition covered if you don't make a lot
Yeah I know how you guys feel. My hometown is Gettysburg Pa and I would love to go to GB college except I can only afford community for now.
OP on a serious note, I was in the same situation. I could not get financial aid due to my parents' incomes.. Yet my parents still couldn't afford to support me in college (full time) because they had their own debts, mortgages, etc.    So instead, I took some courses part time at community college while making monthly payments (monthly payments were around $500) and worked full time in a restaurant. Saved up cash from when I was 18-24 and then began attending full time at 24 since I am now "independent" and can receive the financial aid I need.    If you graduate CC with a good GPA, most states have a matriculation program where you can move on to finish your bachelor's at a state school at a significantly low cost-possibly free. For example, in Massachusetts, if you graduate with a GPA of 3.2 or above you'll get scholarship money from the state to attend a UMass and if you're working a low-wage job (or unemployed), you'll get pellgrant money and qualify for federal loans (if needed).    If you do well academically, it's very possible to get a college education on no debt in Massachusetts (and most other states I presume). Hope this helps if you're interested in forwarding your education. 
The American Dream got leased out.  We just work to ensure other people can have it.  Believe me, I know this feeling all to well. I've been wanting to get a degree for 25 years but there has never been the time or the money...even my GI Bill expired before I could find a way to use it.
Obama Apology Tour in action.
Where are all the redditors who constantly cry about college prices not up in arms about this? Why are foreigners who offer nothing to us getting free school?
We have tons of Saudi college students in our town going to the local state school.... our illustrious Univ president has some special deal struck with their oil-grubbing parents....  All the while I see lots of poor country folks slaving away at low paying jobs... sometimes they scrounge up enough to go to the local junior college or tech school.  
Academic scholarships for making good grades go a long way. My tuition was like $200/semester, the rest was covered for like a 3.5 GPA.
How does this even happen? Did he have loans or was it free?
wait do immigrants and refugees usually get free money for college? or did he earn some sort of scholarships and got a free ride?
Can confirm. Came from a middle class family, attended a public university in Texas, now working my ass off (barely making anything) and living at home to pay off over $80,000 in college loans. And I finished in four years and had a little assistance my freshman year. 
[deleted]
Right.  WTF 
But you're a fucking white male?
Upvoted !!
I couldn't get a non tourist VISA to the US yet people can jump a border, attend college (I assume on some scholarship designed for non-whites) and be proud of their illegal status. This is why illegal immigrants are actually more privileged than most.
mfw minimum wage is below minimum needed to survive unless I live with 3 other people in a small apartment in bumfuck nowhere.
Obviously the OP is full of their "privileged" views.    Somalia is a great wealth of knowledge and peace.  
Truth BOMB. This is what's wrong with America. Our own citizens cant even afford college let alone an illegal immigrant. Classy America. Real classy. How about take care of your citizens FIRST and foremost. Before illegals who get free food, free healthcare, free college and free housing. FUCK THAT!!!! Trump will slowly drain this swamp we call The United States Of America and truly make it pure and great again. With our help. MAGA!!!!
Cool terrorism, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the white house? We should inspire more kids to culturally enrich oppressive white males. It's what makes America great.
Anyone here read *Hillbilly Elegy* by J.D. Vance?
America first! 
Hillary Clinton SMASHES the glass ceiling and becomes the 1ST WOMAN IN HISTORY to lose the same election TWICE.
Carly Fiorina lost this election twice before it was cool
Please clap: Jeb and Hillary 
someone needs to produce a retrospective documentary on how hillary clinton was the worst presidential candidate of all time. she had virtually every conceivable advantage possible; she had most money (~1 billion) ever raised for a campaign, entire DNC primary process rigged in your favor from the start, wall street surrogates, liberal media conglomerate/monstrosity taking cues from your campaign, and the president of the united states (with a 54% approval rating) literally campaigning for her and flying place to place on the air force one, AND SHE STILL MANAGED TO LOSE. 
So proud of this woman. She started her career riding the coat tails of Bill Clinton and finished it by getting slaughtered by a real estate developer with zero political experience. Absolutely inspiring.    Edit: http://www.nationalreview.com/article/437949/hillary-clinton-accomplishments-not-much
HAHAHAHA! As an American woman, I approve this message!

What goes around comes around and Hilary is getting what she deserves, nothing...#Maga
At first you don't succeed, kill everyone involved and use your foreign blood money to compromise your political adversaries and cower any critics into silence 
Legit laughs from reading this headline!!
Over budget and behind schedule 
First to win the popular vote twice, while utterly failing, too!!!1!
Technically 3 times if you include the primaries...
Carly Fiorina already lost the Republican nomination twice.  Hillary just can't help but come in second place.
Made me kek
I remember when she was a wee lad, who started her bid to lose this election by having to dodge sniper fire on her way off the airplane. 
First women to get away with Treason, first women to get away with multiple murders for political reasons.  The list goes on and on.
I still laugh about how she rented the auditorium with the glass ceiling on election day just because they were so certain she'd win and would be able to point up to it like "We broke it guys!!"
Careful, you might trigger r/all
**#NOTMYPRESIDENT**
Wasn't she the one going on about how it's Sooo Un-American NOT TO BLINDLY ACCEPT THE INITIAL VOTING RESULTS - No matter What??  ....I guess she just proved her own point...   
thank god she was not the first president of my gender. What a disgrace that would have been.
counting her loss against obama, she's lost three times!  she's the best, at being the worst.
Alright guys we might have our differences on policy and political views, but GOD DAMN that is some funny shit.
Don't forget losing the nomination 8 years ago.  Smashing all kinds of records here.
Her failure rate is unprecedented.
Lol, so unlikeable.
Clinton lost in 2008 too. She's on a roll. 
From a random FB post, what do you think? "Ambassador Stevens was sent to Benghazi in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Remember that name... Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. The Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Committee, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. This is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers supplied to the enemy by Obama and Hillary and they'd be caught had it hit the fan. Sound about right Hillary?"
Nobody believed she could do it, but she still did!  Is there anything those jowls can't do?   Oh yeah, be President, they can't do that.  
#Fuck that bitch
what glass ceiling?  kellyanne led a campaign to victory despite the new york times saying trump had a 1% chance to win!
Even the Bills only lost one superbowl per season.
I think part of the lefts problem is the fact they had to rationalize voting for this slobbed-out drunk career criminal. What an freak show.
Carly Fiorina kind of lost the same election twice too during the primaries.  So as usual Hillary is a day late and a dollar short.

I've actually had my female friends say out loud that they voted hillary because having out first female president would just be cool. Because it's not even politics that matters, just a race to those milestones that don't even matter.

I wish her campaign would rent the Javitz center in there and hold another viewing party for the recount. I enjoyed the tears so much at the last one!
Im so happy I can tell my little daughter that if she choses to be a criminal she can do it 
She was drunk and incontinent 99% of the time
I cannot understand how people with different political views can see this as cruel, at all. There was a remark on here earlier from someone saying that this post was "cruel" and we are being "dicks"...does she watch the news at all??? Has she not seen all the biased hatred out there on Trump? This post is not at all cruel. Nothing I've seen by The Donald is cruel. Its opinionated...which is an American right, so rock on folks! Keep up the support! 
Hi /r/all 
I think she did that on purpose. She wanted to break at least one glass ceiling in her lifetime.

I'd give Hillary the clap, but she already has it
But she's a fucking white female!!!
Jill stein has been losing for a long ass time though.
"We make it clap"
Good. We are constitutional republic not a democracy. And I hate that the "left" feels that we are. If they had their way New York, California, and such would control the US.  I'm so grateful for our system at the moment, Horrible cities can't control the rest of America. It is great.  I'm just a Pennsylvanian that wants to live alone in the woods without the government intruding in my life. But I have to deal with government bullshit to try and obtain this goal and enjoy my life.

I normally don't call women bitches but Hillary Clinton is such a dumb bitch.

A Message from President-Elect Donald J. Trump
##Main points:  - Agenda based on a simple core principle: **Putting America First.**  - **Trade:** submit notification of intent to withdraw from TPP negotiations.  - **Energy:** cancel job-killing restrictions on the production and harvesting of American energy.  - **Regulations:** formulate a rule that says for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.  - **National Security:** ask the DoD and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to come up with a comprehensive plan to protect against cyber attacks and conventional attacks.  - **Immigration:** investigate visa programs that undercut the American worker.  - **Ethics:** Five year ban on executive officials that leave the administration, and lifetime ban on executive officials that lobby on behalf of a foreign government.
Trump! I've missed this man's rallies and listening to him speak almost everyday, so this is a treat.

The fake media hates Trump speaking directly to the people like this.     ~~Didn't obama say he would do something like this 8 years ago? I cant remember.~~  I guess he does, Its just no one cares since he is the biggest presidential failure in history.
"I hate you CNN, you're all liars and you should be ashamed! In fact, I'm just going to create my own videos and talk directly to the American people!"  I can't get enough of this!
And I mean everyone. 
**TRANSPARENCY**
fuck yes. take it straight to the people. fuck msm.
He's such an animated speaker, you can see him trying to keep his hands in his lap. It makes him that much more relatable and endearing. Not a political robot. Just a man talking to the people in a professional manner.
#PRESIDENTIAL
Listening to him is so awesome. I love his messages. They're so honest. We haven't had a president like him in a while. 
Who needs MSM, Trump just talks directly to the people.  Why you think MSM hates when Trump uses Twitter (hes not being presidential boohoo, he should give up his account to his staff blah blah)? That puts them out of a job.

I think that a subtle hint at re-regulating H-1B visa.  A $320k/year subject matter expert.   Cool, come right in, want to become a citizen, bring the family.  36k/year ***ACCOUNTING*** job at Apple Inc.   Fuck no!  Hire American you twits.   H-1B isn't a cost control device for making 3yr bulk labor units.

#SO IMPORTANT 
It's still so surreal that we've actually won and that Trump is actually the next President but here we are.  This man will go down in history as one of the greats.
DAY ONE. This isn't eight years of broken promises. This is the "getting stuff done" President.

#MY PRESIDENT
DAY ONE MAGA PLAN!  Trade: Withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and instead negotiate fair bilateral trade deals!  Energy: Cancel job-killing restrictions on production of American entery!  Regulation: For every NEW regulation TWO old regulations must be ELIMINATED!  Develop and plan to protect infrastructure from ATTACKS of all types!  Direct Dept. of Labor to INVESTIGATE Visa programs that undercut AMERICAN WORKERS.  DRAIN THE SWAMP: Impose a 5 year ban on executive officials becoming lobbyists after leaving the administration and a LIFETIME ban on those officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.
He is a great speaker. Finally, a real leader! 
# We are going to Make America Great Again. 
Pretty good idea to put out the information this way considering the way media outlets are twisting Melania and Barron staying in NY until June.  The kid is finishing the school year at his current school and libtards are giving them shit for it.
#THIS IS HOW YOU LEAD
I like how Trump calls a meeting with the media to bitch them out, then releases his own damn media.  He's not fucking around: This guy gets shit done!
Made me feel all warm inside 
Trump doesn't need the lamestream legacy media, he IS HIS OWN MEDIA! Directly to the people!
I love it! He doesn't need the media - he's speaking directly to the American people. 
I don't know how to explain it, but whenever I hear this guy speak I feel weirdly positive and motivated.
Is it possible for the president to do more rallies? You know, just for everyone to have some fun and patriotic moments to share.
I still cannot fathom the fact that Trump actually pulled this off -- he actually won.    Watching Trump officially talk about his first 100 days in office feels so weird (in a good way).
This really is the best timeline. How did it all go so right?   #China: BTFO   #TPP: BTFO   #Mexico: BTFO   #Lobbyists: BTFO   #Hippies: BTFO    I think I legit teared up a little watching that 
No thread about it in /r/redacted front page lol.  This is the President-elect.   
It's fucking happening!!!!!  Holy shit.  I bet this was done with one fucking take.  The ONLY was this could be any better would be:  1) Melania in background petting a cat in her arms.  Cat wearing mini MAGA hat.  2) Trump with full beard  Aside from that... 9.5 out of 10!!!!  MAGA!!

Presidential 
Thank you Mr President! 
**SO PROUD TO HAVE VOTED FOR THIS PATRIOT - WHO SPEAKS TO AND FIGHTS FOR (ALL) THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.**
This is like a dream. Did we meme ourselves into a parallel reality?
I hated this guy.  I literally worked on Hillary's campaign.  I grew up in the 90's and I loved Bill, so sure I'd vote for Hillary.  I did in the 2008 primary in fact.    This year I knew she sucked but i convinced myself she would win and I wanted to be on the winning side.  I hate being a loser.  I hate it so much.  It's been killing me inside these last two weeks.  God, she sucked, she sucked so hard.  And then this video.  Guys, this video was amazing.  These are all GOOD ideas and they are all things the president can do on day 1.    And I'm saying to myself, damn, what if I was wrong about him? What if The_Donald has been right along?  The evidence so far certainly says he has been.  He did win in a landslide.  There were no brakes.   Im not there yet, but he's started winning me over.
History made, centipedes.   That was wonderful. 
[deleted]
already a more personal, personable president and he's not even president yet.    +1 for fireside chats every 2-4 weeks throughout his presidency.  after the endless shitshow propagated by the MSM, it would be refreshing to get it straight from him. 
I love this direct approach at communication. Makes me all giddy inside. 
I don't think I've ever giggled in excitement listening to an elected official speak before.
It's like Obama is already forgotten. Getting rid of him is basically just a formality at this point.
I have to say. So far I'm impressed. I believe he is taking the right steps. I was so against trump in the beginning and after Bernie endorsed Hilary, I started listening. The guy is one resilient mother fucker. I love it. I'm proud to call Donald J Trump my president. 
I genuinely like Trump. Sure he's said some shit in the past but who hasn't? It proves that he's human and we need a human to lead us. It seems like he genuinely wants what's best for America and by that notion alone I have nothing but respect for him. This is coming from a moderate btw.
Kek -> top
I RATE THIS PRESIDENTIAL/10
We love you President-elect Trump!  No matter what they do to try and stop our movement, we will fight for you as you fight for us.  Together, we will Make America Great Again!
AND HE MEANS EVERYONE
Amazing, I especially loved the lifetime ban of foreign government lobbying. That was news to me. I knew of the 5 year ban. All of it music to my ears.
CTR is here downvoting, post triggering words to stop it!  God, Country and the American Way!
>Withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership  What a boss. Thumbs up from the UK
61%.....who is paying for CTR at this point?
As a black independent, this shit actually sounds good. TPP gone after Dems are trying to ship more jobs and freedom away from the US. Very happy he mentioned our steel industry. How my city built a 3 billion dollar bridge and got all the steel from china was fucking disgusting. The lobbyists ban... awesome, and reviewing these fucking visas, so these tech companies can stop passing up Americans for cheap labor. Hillary wouldn't have done none of this but continued obamas policies. I'm hopeful and we must all give him a chance. 
But Drumpf has no policies!!!!
Damn I love this
So I didn't hear a single thing I disagreed with. And this is a Bernie loving lifetime liberal speaking. I especially loved the investigation into fraud and abuse with our Visa programs.   I work in IT and I have seen the H1-B visa program absolutely demolish the industry. 
non-Trump voter here, but I actually like what he is saying here. Can someone tell me if there is absolutely anything wrong with this 5 year ban? It seems awesome...
Been wondering, is OP **the** manafort? If so, want to say hats off to guiding the campaign when the campaign needed what you had to offer.
#**PRESIDENTIAL**
Very Presidential message. I look forward to the next four years. 
Making Fire-side Chats great again!
As a Canadian. I'm jealous you guys have this great man! #DrainThe Swamp #HillaryForPrison #MAGA
Trump made me proud to be an American once again.
This is so good. Can't wait until he takes office.
Hey, i am so fucking pumped!.
Talk like a true boss.

Nothing new.   I think this is more about showing us how he will be delivering his speeches from now instead of having it filtered through the networks. 
Do I need CNN's permission to view this video?
IT'S FUCKING HAPPENING:[Audio] Seymour Hersh confirms Seth Rich was WikiLeaks source and there was no hack, Wikileaks just tweeted the audio
The fact that Wikileaks disseminated this gives it a lot more weight than Sy Hersh saying what he said.  Not saying that it's happening, but Assange distributing this speaks volumes.
Holy shit, this is the most credible proof to date that Seth Rich was actually the Wikileaks source.  Blown away by this.

Remember when Ramen was asking about Dropbox and if it's monitored? Makes sense now.   https://youtu.be/V3vOv06gEY4  Also Rod Wheeler interview from her: https://youtu.be/2p8at6PD4L8  Creepy part, these were uploaded to YouTube weeks ago. With like 42 views.   We got em.   Here is the post article linking Seymour Hersh convo to Butowsky  http://archive.is/KsqZ2   Quote: "At some point before or during February, Butowsky apparently speaks with veteran journalist Seymour Hersh, who Butowskysays indicated a link between Rich and the FBI. Hersh told Folkenflik it was “gossip” and that Butowsky “took two and two and made forty-five out of it.”  That doesn't sound like the recording I heard.   Looks like someone is lyinggggggg  
I…worked on this story for a year…and…he just…he tweeted it out
If Assange Tweeted it, it's legit. 
#"IF THAT BASTARD WINS WE ALL HANG FROM NOOSES"
He rambles alot, but this is the core of what he was saying for those who cant listen to the whole thing.  >"he had submitted a series of documents, of emails, from the dnc... he offered a sample - a dozen of emails, and said, "i want money" - but later, WikiLeaks got the password, they got access to the Dropbox, he also let people know who he was dealing with - he also shared this Dropox with a couple of friends, "so if anything happens to me its not gonna solve your problem", Ok? I don't know what that means.
So Hersh  believes the guy that leaked the emails that is widely accepted as the main reason why Hillary lost, was just a coincidence that he was murdered in one of the safest neighborhoods in DC.  Wow.
Protip for shariablue: downvotes aren't going to prevent top Democrats from going to jail.

Over at world news they are all reeeing saying it's a conspiracy theory and fox won the right to lie. Meanwhile their media pumps out fake news every fucking minute of the day. These cucks piss me off sooo badly. 
This is a hell of a somethingburger.

Must be pretty sad existence to be paid for downvoting. 
I have no good or clever comment, I'm just posting so I can say I was there when history happened.
Pedes, we were all here when it HAPPENED.  This is it. Heads start rolling soon. Birds start singing to protect their own lives. It's unraveling faster than they (the Demonic DNC) can keep up with. They no longer have ANY control over this, merely their brute force of murdering people. They are backed into a corner, so expect lashing out like we've never seen.  Also, Get your tendie catching gloves on, because these tendies will be extra salty hot!

Wheeler was told to sue fox news to bring the rich coverage to other networks so the hammer can be dropped tommorrow. George webb was right it's probably the younger Awan brother.

Calling it now. Seth was working with his brother, and maybe others, to extort money from someone within the DNC.
Can someone write a transcript of the audio?
They can believe Russia hacked DNC, but it's ridiculous to think it was a DNC staffer
#HAPPENING LEVEL:   #IT'S
I was at defcon this past weekend. Talked to three Russian kids working as malware researchers for Kasperky. They laugh at the idea of election hacking by Russia
Fuck, it was just starting to get interesting when it cut out. Looks like there's enough there to lock away plenty of criminals though.  spez: The downvotes are only increasing my confidence that this is something significant
Hey, liberals, if you're really so sure this is all just a conspiracy, why are you blatantly brigading and downvoting every new comment? Just curious. Surely you must be getting red-pilled as you realize you're earning Soros-bucks to try and hide a news story (and failing miserably at it, it's still over 15k upvotes even with reddit's "imrpoved algorithms" that handicap this sub).

Gimme dem downvotes bitches!!!!  #SethRichWasMurdered
Well every journalist who wrote more than one Russia story with unknown sources while not mentioning Seth besides saying conspiracy should rethink their job and life choices.
His description of events makes the most sense of anything I've heard yet.
If these leftists keep poking the bear, I really think Assange might say fuck it and spill the beans with proof. I know he's a principled man, but how many lies can a person listen to before they've had enough and just drop the hammer?
Just leaving this wiki description of Sy Hersh because a lot of people refuse to Google.  Seymour Myron "Sy" Hersh (born April 8, 1937) is an American investigative journalist and political writer based in Washington, D.C. He is a longtime contributor to The New Yorker magazine on national security matters and has also written for the London Review of Books since 2013.  Hersh first gained recognition in 1969 for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its cover-up during the Vietnam War, for which he received the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting. In 2004, he notably reported on the US military's mistreatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. He has also won two National Magazine Awards and five George Polk Awards. In 2004, he received the George Orwell Award.
I am death, destroyer of the Democrats
13.9k upvotes....hmmm wonder how many it really is without reddit's "new and improved" algorithm. 
Here they come.  EDIT:Man what a barrage of hits to the ↓side.
For sure, excellent analysis. He did work in DWS district, during the time she called another law office investigating with her voice disguised in a modulator. We're talking within a week or two. Too much here to be coincidence in my opinion, though you are 100% right to suspect mafia or organized crime. However, DNC is not ruled out when discussing organized crime haha
Shariablue, attack me too!
This sounds more like who ever he is talking to leaked this phone call because otherwise why would he speak about Wikileaks in the third person when a representative was on the phone...? Also I'm willing to bet that Seth Rich was killed by the Awan family for getting close to their turf. They have probably been selling the emails to people in the middle east. 
Actually, what he's saying is that Seth Rich was trying to sell the emails to Wikileaks but someone (maybe related with Wikileaks) was able to get into Seth's files and get all the emails. This corroborates with some info that's been floating out there, that Seth wasn't an innocent angel in all of this. It also completely damns the "muh Russia!" narrative.
The MSM is as easy to read as a pop-up book.. knew something was going to drop today with the Fox News lawsuit bs

Pathetic paid commie downvote jackasses.
Someone asked Reddit what conspiracy makes too much sense to be ignored and I posted Seth Rich's murder....downvotes ensued haha
This and the other video are interesting.  I don't like that they don't confirm their identities on the tapes, but these are very likely real and credible.   Seems like someone at the FBI knows...

This won't be over for me until Seth Rich's killers are exposed, and everyone who pushed the Russia story is shamed out of public life. 
The down vote squad is here, their weaknesses are as follows;  Logic  Critical Thinking  Binary Genders  The Constitution  Full frontal nudity  Feel free to use any of the above to your advantage, they will shreek at the sight of non-dyed hair or a male-female marriage. 
Commenting to be a part of history. Its's been a wild ride with you pede's. I'm tired of lurking and ready to see some heads roll. MAGA!
Everyone here knew it from the goddamn start. There were a million and one signs that said that Seth Rich was the leaker and that the "muh Russia" DNC email hack story was nothing but a lie, but so many people put fingers in their ears and wouldn't listen.    **We. All. Knew. It.**   Hopefully it makes a few lurkers think, "What else are they right about?" (Illegal votes favoring Clinton? Media lies? Hillary's crimes with her server? There are so many things that I hope people will be willing to actually consider now.)
I can feel the rumblings from the UK.   ##IT'S HAPPENING!!!
Gripping my AR extra tight right now.  I want indictments immediately
Hillary clinton is fucking disgusting. She ordered the hit on seth rich, then made a speech 2 days later, using his death as an excuse to push for gun control. A vile human being.
Fuck yes here we go.

First off, Hersh did indeed make these statements, they are in the lawsuit: https://www.scribd.com/document/355258439/Fox-Suit  I've been scouring twitter. Here is the left's current defense:  > In an interview this week, Hersh sounds unconvinced. > "I hear gossip," Hersh tells NPR on Monday. "[Butowsky] took two and two and made 45 out of it."  From: http://www.npr.org/2017/08/01/540783715/lawsuit-alleges-fox-news-and-trump-supporter-created-fake-news-story  However, Hersh was talking about the DNC murdering Rich, he was NOT talking about Rich being the source of the e-mails. NPR selectively quoted Hersh. Hersh DOES still believe Rich was the source of the e-mails. It's a really weak defense, but it's all they have. They're going to try and run with it. It won't work.
They thought they could skate because Hillary was going to win.  They thought wrong.
Thats it, i see this fucker on the front page of /ALL/ with a GLORIOUS 12k (more like 50k) uptrumps; YOU GET AN UPTRUMP AND YOU GET AN UPTRUMP AND YOU GET AN UPTRUMP, EVERYONE GETS UPTRUMPS!  JUSTICE FOR SETH!
Holy fuck!  I fucking knew it! Praise Kek! /#Justice4Seth. Whoever they got to kill him obv wasnt really a pro and s/he panicked and forgot to take his wallet.
I see the paid brain fucked shills are hard at work down voting all new posts. -15 or more for most.   Pathetic tactics, I'm with the liberals on this, some people shouldn't be allowed to have the internet. 
**IT'S AFRAID!**
We just invited everyone from the 50k post to see you guys running downvote scripts! GG

Just commenting to say I was here when it happened 
Warp speed pedes, attention on deck
Such a strange coincidence the guy who leaked the DNC emails was robbed* and shot not long after. Unfortunate timing hey. 
Is it a coincidence that this coincides with a New FBI director being confirmed?
Fuck Reddit and their russian bullshit.  First thing I'm going to do when charges start getting handed out is report redacted to the FBI for aiding and abetting criminals.
quick rundown?
is this why CNN is running an article saying the Seth Rich conspiracy was started by Republicans in Trumps administration? lmao

Check R/ALL and rising

No. It is not "clearly antagonist toward the greater reddit community". That's a real stretch. The lie is clear in the next sentence "I'd expect it to drop sharply". Read it's not my view and I just know everyone else agrees with me.   This is an incoming US President hours out from inauguration. I guarantee if it had been HRC they would have expected massive up votes once it reached reddit all. I don't currently live in the US. Support outside of the US is high for DJT. They are so wrong on this. It's censorship again.   
SALT STOCKS UP 10 FOLD
GOD DAMN SPEZ!
[deleted]
I love what is happening! The picture is on /all like 6 times now. This is truly the best timeline.  I do fear that the admins will use this to shut us down though, doesn't mean we should stop though.
NOBODY CAN STOP US NOW!!!!!! NO BRAKES!!!!!
They can't even man up and admit they fucked with it.  Can't even lie properly.  You can't let the vote market play out and have exactly "0" votes.  These fuckers are full of shit but guess what?  President Trump is still your president and you will get dragged along for the MAGA whether you like it or not.  You'll still be salty 8 years from now from all the ass-blasting you're getting from trying to deny President Trump but your life and the lives of other cucks around you will be that much better thanks to him.
Is that a first? We are already winning!
I'm sure that response was 100% truthful. No editing done
Lol the title is the truth. Liberals can't handle the truth which is why they love FAKE NEWS LOL
#HERE TO MAGA  #NO BRAKES
In light of r/all the winning today I'd like to share a story.  I just interviewed a nice young lady. The interview went really well. But just to be sure I googled her and found her fb page. I wasn't logged in so I didn't see much, however in the list of things liked I found:  Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., USA Patriots for Donald Trump, Amanda Bell #keepinitreal, U.S. Career Institute, Alex Jones, Younique - Corporate  #You're hired

INB4 they try to ban this sub for posting Trump pics after they censor us
>title is pretty clearly antagonistic towards the "greater reddit community"   Well hey, let's see what they mean by "antagonistic"   >The official portrait of our President should be the #1 most upvoted post in reddit's history.   Oh wow /r/The_Donald, how could you be so *antagonistic* to the rest of reddit.
~~Here early but don't have a witty comment. Upvote this and I'll edit something in once I think of it.~~  ~~FeelsBadMan.jpg~~  Leave it to the admins to fuck with some shit then pretend it didn't happen. Sounds just about like the last several times it has happened...  This fuckery that is afoot behind the reddit scenes is killing this website. 'Tis a shame.   Can't stop Trump though.

Lmao our entire front page is filled with the God Emperor. I fucking love this place.

re : "pretty clearly antagonistic towards the "greater reddit community""  Um - what? That's the best excuse they could come up with? Holy FUCK how triggered can you get?
PRETTY CLEARLY THE TITLE TRIGGERS CUCKS SO ITS AT 0 
"antagonistic towards the greater reddit community"  how is a photo of the president antagonistic?  do people find history books antagonistic?  a fucking president is being inaugurated soon and that's somehow offensive?
The Donald front page, New and Rising are absolutely fucking glorious right now.  http://archive.is/dIKEN  http://archive.is/o1MvH  http://archive.is/XfA8L
Here's my problem with their answer:  That post no longer shows how many votes it has, while all other posts still do.  That post was targeted by Admins.
[deleted]
Seven of the top 25 spots on /r/all.  So glorious to see Trump's face there again.  (I just checked with an incognito window.)
Hey, admins, it would be nice if you fucking came out and told us the real fucking truth about what's going on. because the Streisand effect is in full fucking force right now.
What the fuck is antagonistic about the title?
[deleted]
They're lying and fucking with us.  Last time they fucked with us Spez had to go into hiding.
Our train has broken through reddit's singularity karma barrier. Our brakes have reached their final form. NO BRAKES!!!!!
Seeing that post hang there with 0 votes while all the others have thousands was amazing.  Their incompetence is second to none.
#"GREATER REDDIT COMMUNITY"  LMAO 
So it was downvoted by the anti trump bots most likely
**WE ARE THE GREATER REDDIT COMMUNITY**
Reread it... it was antagonistic??? Fuck the liberals and fuck the admins. There was nothing antagonistic about it. It was stating a fact and liberals got triggered plain and simple 
Holy shit at the entire page of massively upvoted Donalds. I fucking love you guys.
Holy shit we're number 1 on r/all!!!
Lmao reddit is falling apart at the seams from our magnificent high energy
I haven't seen this sub dominate r/all like this in months.

"Reddit is down right now for a scheduled censoring of the_donald"
aaaaaannndddd I just upvoted every post.  
Tomorrow we MAGA!
So they admit the "greater reddit community" (lesser) are so fucking weak minded, mentally unstable and petty that they can't even see a pic of the freely elected President of the United States. Pretty fucking sad indeed. 
My hand is hurting from clicking the upvote on so many trump images. 
[HAHAHAHAHAHAHA](http://i.imgur.com/47GCfvZ.png)  You fucking madmen! I love this subreddit.
Cut off one head.  10,000 more shall take its place.  HAIL /r/THE_DONALD
What the fuck is antagonistic about a portrait of the next President? The title was not antagonistic at all.
We literally broke their algorithm lmao. We have like 5 posts in the top 20 when it's supposed to be limited to 2.
How on earth is this antagonistic to the greater reddit community?  The reddit admins are stretching further and further for excuses.
Would you like to know less? /redacted.
Oh, nooo... really admins? Who are you kidding?
So basically we lost the popular vote on Reddit but it didn't matter? HAHAHAHHA

So reddit got triggered so hard they broke the website.  Good times.
The fact that it instantaneously reverted to zero, no matter who voted what, proves they are full of shit.
inb4 "yeah we've decided to change the algorithm again, no no totally not related to t_d"
The amount of energy here right now is unbelievable. I feel it channeling through me as I post trump pics with fury
After several hours I came back to Reddit and saw this, started laughing like an idiot in the middle of the office.  You guys are swell.
DID I HIT A NERVE WITH [MY POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5oyzbi/reddit_admins_right_now/) ADMINS?  #TRIGGERED
A picture of the President of the United States is *"...pretty clearly antagonistic towards the "greater reddit community".*  Wew, lads, what timeline is this? We've had goofy fucking Prime Ministers here who people fucking hated, but people were never shielded from viewing their image. Have people become that weak willed?
That response is the most obvious lie I've heard in a long time.
Riiiiiiiiiighttttt. What are the chances that the post went *exactly* to zero?    Not very high.
Lol they are so full of shit. No, it didn't magically get 'huge number of downvotes' spontaneously.
harvard is literally shaking
Did she just assume that white boy's gender????
> Two of these are genders and the rest are mental illnesses.  Kek. Mentally filing this line for later use.
"Who lets these people out of the house". I'm sure that's what that guy thought of her.
I've got a secret for her... 'black boys' think the same thing.
Maybe Ivy League isn't the best fit for you, sweetie.
How come it's always shaking with these people?
The truth hurts.  
If your college teaches that their are more than two genders you are going to a fake college.
what happens to her come the harsh winter? 
There are only two genders.  Edit: for the babies IMing me to inform me of what you learned at some shit college. I would like to say: There are two genders, or there are no genders.

To this stupid bitch: I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder because I was involved in a car crash at 16. So you saying you are "literally shaking" because someone points out that there are only two genders (a known fact by the way) is really fucking offensive. How about you live a day of your life where slightly loud noises startle the fuck out of you. How about you live ages 16-19 too afraid to drive a car because you are afraid you will be involved in another accident. How about you stay awake until 3 AM on an average night because of PTSD. How about you have a recurring nightmare of an accident and end up waking up at odd hours of the night freaking out. Until you experience these situation you are free to fuck off. 
#How does she know he's a white boy? Did she just assume his gender and race?
So, having an opinion about something that is biological fact..... Yeah.   I would be willing to accept that there are more than two genders, including XXY (Klinefelters) and XYY genetic syndromes.   This girl can continue to go cry in a corner or whatever makes her feel better. Life is tough little snowflake. 
kek overload
How much harder is she gonna shake when she realizes she proved his point?
What the hell good is shaking supposed to do?  Cuss someone out if they hurt your fee fees!  Have an argument!
[removed]
It's funny because it's true.
Maybe calling every member of a huge group of people a pejorative like "white boy", and expecting that group to respect your every whim and request isn't a realistic long term strategy.
Dude. Don't laugh. It's a really serious issue. She was shakily littering.
> who lets these people out of the house  We don't have to ask for permission because we dont still live with our parents.
She has a mental illness herself if overhearing a strangers comment on something makes her emotionally broken and physically shake. She should be in a mental institute getting treatment, not in a place of learning.
Maybe she (he?) will shake some sense into herself.
I'M SHAKING LOL
Lmao, stupid snowflake.
She made it up.  Her **Fake Tweet** is obvious because her profile pic reeks of self loathing.
God, the fact that anyone takes these multi gender asshats seriously is baffling.
Penis or vagina. That's it. You wan't to take it any way you like, fine. Making genders up is ludicrous. Mashing your privates is where we are now. You have a dick, keep it. A vagina, keep it. Figure your fucking brain out before you start cutting your parts apart.
More leftist projection. First of all she "assumes his gender" (REE) but she calls him a "boy" when it's her that's acting like a complete immature child
We're taking job placement tests and one of the questions on them is "Male or Female?" and I immediately started screaming.      I convulsed uncontrollably until the medics took me away, said I was the WORST case of special snowflake they've ever seen.  WORST.      I'm still shaking. 
There are two genders. Live with it. Trans is not a gender, it's a transition from one gender to another gender. Still two genders. If you're shaking, maybe you should do a check up in the hospital. It might be alcohol dependency, nerve damage, Parkinsons' disease or your vibrator that's stuck. 
[deleted]
What the fuck is a white girl doing saying white boy, just puts an exclamation mark on her stupidity. ...  Dick or No Dick? should do for this stuff. Overthinking biological imperatives is uselessly exhausting.
You know at times like this I remember is was just over 70 years ago when some of the bravest, most honorable men that have ever lived stormed a beach, armed to the teeth, knowing they would likely die, for the sake of our nation.  In just over 70 years, we've gone from storming Normandy, to this bs.  What would our ancestors think of us now?  How is this even possible?
Maybe I'm just drunk, but aren't there only 2 genders? I just left my local bar after my dart league match, and there were males and females there. I was actually out in a public place with people of 2 genders (multiple races), but for fucks sake two genders. I'm confused. 
There's no need for extra gender markers. I'm a transwoman, I will checkmark the female slot on any paper UNLESS it is medical related, in which case they need to know the birth gender.
"White" boy could actually be Hispanic, Russian, or even Lebanese.  Just saying - she's judging by external appearance.
THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS YOU FUCKING MORON

He's right. (I'm not allowed out of the house)
What's with the shaking? I have shaked when I am cold or when my sugar drops... words have never made me shake
Gotta love it how a blonde white girl can say "a white boy" .
Why was the fact that he was white important?
"When we send our people to Harvard, we are not sending our best and brightest, believe me."
Harvard and all these other crybully safespace "Ivy Leagues" reputations aren't going to be worth much soon, believe me.
HES A FUCKING WHITE MALE!
Their ultimate goal in life is to be literally shaken 
Hey sweetie, your father was a white man!
A white boy?? How dare you assume his race and gender!
I'm a lesbian trapped in a man's body.
that based af fucking white male was telling the truth
HAHAHAHAHA, yeah. Proof that they ARE mentally ill.
The Harvard Bias Test is an online exercise offered by the university, not a class at Harvard. You can rest assured these kids do not go there.  https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html
Three Genders..  Male, Female, Retarded.
18-16 = The Amount of Genders there Are
Gender dysphoria is actually in the DSM-V, but it's not classified as a full blown mental disorder.  Being someone who is actually transgender, I really actually wish the tolerant left would stop trying to represent people like me.  It's embarassing and ineffective.  I actually don't even bother correcting people for their mistakes because... well...  I don't want people telling me what to think, so why should I force other people to think in a certain way?  If you want respect, you have to give it first.  I actually wake up everyday thinking I'm sick in some way, but I don't really care because I chose this life.  I chose to follow my own path.  I'm a sick deplorable mentally ill centepede.  Wouldn't have it any other way.
IT IS ALL A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT.   YOU GOT A BAG OF DANGLERS & SHE'S GOT A PILE OF MEDIUM WELL ROAST BEEF.   Nuff said about that right there.
It's true, what was once considered a great educational institution is literally shaking to the ground from catering to these stupid idiotic people and then putting the Harvard stamp of approval on her basket weaving degree.  There are only 2 genders people, male, female and attack helicopters I should know i went to Harvard.....
the_donald is leaking baby!  I hope PC culture dies quickly
Truth hurts sometimes.
Aren't these people obsessed with "microaggression" and other bullshit like that? Yet she calls out someone as a "white boy" as if that matters?  Hypocrites.
You should see how bad they shake when an MC yells "ladies and gentlemen! ", it's like an earthquake I tell ya
Ironic

We live in a hell of a time when someone saying something you think is silly can evoke a physical reaction from you.   I dont believe in purges. But If i did, people this would be the first to go. 
there are only 2 genders.  but if your parents donate enough to harvard, their profs will tell you whatever you want to hear!
Politics aside, that was a fucking hilarious line.
The phrase "literally shaking" is offensive to earthquake survivors. These libs who throw it around need to check their stable fault line privilege 
Two Trump election wins. Two genders.
Why does harvard let these people into their school?
What's up with this "I'm shaking" bullshit?
I usually only have to shake it once and then I'm done.
If differing opinions lead you to shaking uncontrollably , you have a mental illness.    And lol at white **boy**. Imagine if he were black. 
How long before some sharp survey maker just changes it to "Do you possess XX or XY chromosomes?" Checkmate.
I feel sorry for non-cucked young people today who have to filter through idiots like this to find someone to date.
I identify as blue cotton candy on Tuesday and Thursday, tap dance shoes on Wednesday, and a pink kangaroo on Monday and half of Friday. You need to accommodate me because I'm special! 😂😂😂
They are mental illnesses, and were listed as such by Doctors until the liberal PC bullshit invaded reality.  Wait until she reaches the real world 
There are two natural biological sexes, and ordinary people should respect this fact! By the way, The Donald has people from many different backgrounds and sexual orientations! We encourage people to freely act out their ideas, as well as respect them!

This is fucked up! I'm a simple Alabama high school graduate and I know more than Harvard students? Would've definitely chose a different career with this knowledge.  Harvard Q: How many genders are there? Me A: Uhhh 2.
Seriously wtf goes on on american campuses these days   More centipedes are definitely required on campus trigger all these pathetic cucks. 
Whenever I see 'shaking' in one of these posts, I just assume that the shit never happened. 
Jesus, these people are crazy
I don't understand why there has ever been a discussion surrounding gender. I really hope things change soon, we can't sustain this level of retardation 
The fact that they even had more than two options for gender on that test is the more disturbing part tbh.
I'm curious to know the real reason this multiple gender thinking is being pushed what is really behind not only our colleges but our government wants more than one gender.
You made your bed Reddit. Now lie in it.
They are still progressing through stages of grief and /r/the_donald is coming out on top
That's none of your Benghazi. 
I don't see why they had to take us off r/all when they are letting people filter us off it anyways
This is exactly why things keep shooting up to the front page.  They forced everyone that doens't agree with them into one subreddit.  So liberals have the rest of reddit.  The way reddit works, when you concentrate people all in one sub, that sub gets stronger and stronger, allowing it to shape opinions and forge more followers.  Defeating the_donald is easy.  All the moderators that hate this sub need to resign, then the remaining moderators just need to invite everyone from the_donald back to the rest of reddit.  Allow dissenting political opinion, even if you hate it.  In fact, promote conservatives to share their viewpoints.  Anything to get them into your sub instead of this one.  Once you spread the Trump supporters out they will mix with other people.  They will become more moderate, become a bit less of a Trump supporter, and a bit more liberal.  They will also make the rest of reddit a bit less liberal and authortarian left in the process.  Of course the rest of reddit is too stupid to actually do this, so this sub will just keep growing and all the control measures they attempt will fail.  Trump will win in 2020.  Then after Trump gets his to terms he will have sufficiently Trumpified the Republican party.  Pence will win in 2024 and 2028 and be Trump 2.0.  The march will continue until liberals are willing to try and have open political discussions and allow opposing viewpoints again.  The only way they can stop team Trump is to hug them.  At this rate they will just all slowly get converted to team Trump.

To be fair, I think /r/worldnews is actually pretty good too. Not everyone agrees but you see a variety of opinions it seems.

We were the silent majority, but now with the Internet and social media, the left are frightened hearing our voices again. They want us disenfranchised and back underground.   Sorry Dem's look like you won't be getting your single-party socialist state any more XD
Not to mention that we did **NOTHING WRONG.** We only kept getting on the front page of r/all continuously by **REDDIT'S OWN RULES.** We didn't cheat. We didn't use bots. We just had that many people excited enough to keep up our front page presence. Then they changed the algorithm to nerf us, but we were still active enough to consistently stay on the front. This also had the negative side effect of slowing down the influx of fresh content on the front page of r/all as a whole, making the whole site more stale. Every time I came back to the front page after the algorithm change, it would be full of purple links. It wasn't like that before. And brigading is strictly forbidden here so they can't try to pin that on us. Then /u/redacted goes and edits other user's posts (and not the first time he's done that as he claimed) and somehow we're the ones that get fucked over in the ensuing controversy.  These people do NOT care about liberal values anymore. Free speech is a liberal value. They are completely brainwashed by partisan hackery. 
This is essentially the same reason the second most watched cable news show is reruns if the O'Reilly Factor and the most listened to radio program is Rush Limbaugh. 
Don't give them any ideas. I've seen cucks discussing exactly this. How they should "give" us a couple other pro trump subs then drive them against each other to fracture our community. Stronger together. amirite?
Nah, it's not that. It's that this community of total randos of every age, color, religion, gender, political leaning, etc. etc., for MANY reasons, came together and found a more inclusive, high-energy, FUN, crazy HIGHER GROUND on which we agreed to unite. You can't have a group of 310K+ people as varied as we are unify under anything less broad than "we're just super tired of the bullshit, the divisiveness, the exclusion, the HATE, so we've CHOSEN to put aside the smaller issue and focus on the more macro things that NEED TO HAPPEN for us, as a nation, to even begin to get anywhere".   THAT is what makes this domreddit FUCKING GREAT and ffor any of you lurkers and for all of you HATERS, I say, "give it a chance, man. we're going NOWHERE if we cant at least have some civility between us". You don't have to gobble the Trump cawk, you JUST have to come in with an open mind and, truly most importantly, a willingess to look beyong d the veil and see us for who we really are. WE ARE YOU, YOU GUYS. 
Maybe if all people where allowed to have an opinion.
We need to get off the Reddit platform, Not sure if Gab is it, but we need to find something else that is truly free or else build it. That will send the message needed. The same with Twitter. If the playground isn't fair, we build a new playground.
And get news too, like with the Orlando shooting.
When you're autobanned from the rest of the site after posting here once, where else are you gonna go?
Not a huge trump supporter but damn this hits the nail on the head. So many rules now on reddit it's hard not to get slapped if you support anyone. Reminds me of technology banning tesla stuff. Can't talk about technology on the technology subreddit, can't talk politics on the politics subreddit. Fucking backwards day.

YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I love how people keep saying "it isn't even censorship, not that it would matter with how you guys harass the website." or perhaps "It is barely going to change anything anyway" when we are literally censored on almost 100% of reddit. Even after we won the election we can't even talk about Trump positively on /r/redacted
UP UP UP 
It's incredible that the people in control of this site can't tolerate one subreddit that doesn't go along with their narrative. Just one.
BTFO
And basically hold some discussions that are BANNED YOU RAYCISS NAZI from other places (all the rest of) the internet. Also only place you can be conservative, if you are on """""""""""""neutral""""""""""""" /r/p0litics you get near insta-banned.
OP I like your username. 
I think the best solution is the recently given opportunity to customize your r/all so you just get the subs you want. Nomatter who currently dominates r/all, people who don't agree with the sub just can ignore it. Less hate, less trouble.
i really like how trump's popularity has been massively boosted recently
Reddit, protecting free speech by becoming domestic enemies censoring those who support the President.
or the only place to get the real news, meanwhile /r/redacted makes the 18th thread about how Trump farted in the wrong direction.
Reddit has just turned into the biggest President opposition forum on the internet. In the old days, people call them a bunch of treasonous rebels who want to overthrow the government, a criminal entity punishable by death. Let that sink in.
I wish that Reddit didn't have permanent bans to any sub just for stating ideas that are different from those supported by the mods of that sub.   Why can't we change Reddit's policies so that if someone disagrees with a comment in their sub, and that comment is free of profanity, then the moderator can only temporarily ban the user from their sub for a period of 30 days?
Fifth spot on all. Can't keep us down.
It's kind of like how Krauthammer describes the success of Fox News:  "the genius of Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes was to have discovered a niche market in American broadcasting — half the American people."
This is on r/all btw lol
Most of Reddit is a liberal trash heap.  They don't care about integrity.  They just want to have fun and pretend that they are winning at intelligence.  They don't recognize themselves as intellectual animals, deprived of real needs like a good diet and an improving lifestyle, so they try to attack the world anyway they can.  In the machine they've helped create, they are only allowed to attack themselves, so they project their shitty self-image onto other people and "confess their sins" without claiming ownership.  The one who forcefully navigates the dialogue via censorship and threats is the biggest PoS their can be on this site.  Unfortunately that is the CEO of Reddit.
As this post hits the front page...hahaha
As a Fin. This sub has brought me more joy than any other. MSM is so corrupt here you have no idea. I'm so happy there are people like you out there that spread the truth, the MSM (and Reddit) tries to hide.

Just imagine if r/[redacted] was a neutral environment and they ban true harassment and accepted all and everyone they would be so popular
Oh shit top of /r/all.  How ironic.
the 2nd best thing about Trump's victory is all the loser SJWs it has triggered.  Each and every one of which can go straight to hell.
Michael Moore was wrong. It still feels good. 
They're resisting the fact that they are not the mainstream, and if they let the userbase support who they want, it would be overwhelmingly pro Trump
/r/The_Donald is basically a catch-all sub for anyone who is not a blue haired commie SJW (which is basically most normal people out there).
I never thought about it this way. Mind blown.
Pretty much the truth. Trump supporters are sequestered into this ghetto, not allowed out it seems.
Thats none of my business! 🐸😝

Seriously everywhere else is so hostile that it's no surprise we all hang out here a few hundred thousand deep just fucking with the rest of the community.   
Makes you think. Such a big site. So many tens of millions. So few subs that tolerate conservative thought.
I've been banned from 12 subreddits because I support Trump.   My most recent ban was because I stood up for the people whose jobs were saved last week.    Apparently standing up for American jobs isn't tolerated.  Shout out to /r/dataisbeautiful and all the other subreddits I filter.  Eat a dick, fellas.  You lost.  America first.   
Hey Kermit, how's the rainbow connection?
Top 10 with a tag, fuck yo algorithm!!!!
More like Reddit shit the bed. Now lays in it.
That's none of my business....
This rise on conservatism made Reddit so much more bearable, keeping the rampant leftism from getting preachy. Now they're trying to suppress that.
Imagine if the only place to talk about Obama in 2008 was a subreddit called thebackofthebus 
I don't understand why they can pull their BS with T_D, but the Trump spam one can put crap up. I find them offensive.
Reddit's general userbase is retarded/mentally ill. I don't question their thought processes anymore to save myself the brain cells. We're leading them forward out of the darkness and they are going to come out kicking and screaming as we do so.
I voted for Bernie and Hillary.  I didnt start liking Trump until about 1 week after Her loss.  Under a different username I posted in /hillaryclinton , /sanders4prez, /enoughtrumpspamp and /politics.    2,522 post karma 12,006 comment karma redditor for 1 year  In the days after the election I was shadow banned from /hillary for questioning the Queens campaign strategy.  When I post in /politics or /ets *anything* that smells pro trump I get shit on, treated like an idiot and down voted to hell.  For the first time in my 10 yrs on reddit on this username for 1 week I had negative comment karma because I only posted in politics and I went against the hive mind.  All my comments required me to wait 8min between post because my comment karma was too low.  Meanwhile all the circle jerk bitches can post non stop hive mind echo chamber bullshit.  This site has jumped the shark and is on the way down.  I cant wait for the next site to open up.  I came here with the digg migration and cant wait to leave for something better.  The warning shot was when the banned all those subs, fat people hate and so on.  Safe Spaces are here to save us all...

The reddit owners think if they wait you out, they'll win.  They did it with /r/fatpeoplehate
REEEEEEEEEE
So crazy that I cannot post anything even remotely disagreeing with the prevailing hivemind outside of this sub.  Whereas here, you can post nuanced disagreements and be welcomed (I've already posted about how I was originally a Cruz supporter and wasn't downvoted to hell).
WHY ISN'T THE ALGORITHM WORKING REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE?!
If they EVER shut The_D down, it will be like Obi Wan in the original films. 
#TOP KEK for your username
Boom. Got 'em.
The_Donald should rise to millions as Trump keeps winning, it might break the Reddit at some point, we're sorry to inform you again that this train has no brakes
I just checked /r/politics for the first time in months. Jesus Christ. If I ran a speech platform, and that was my purported neutral politics room, I would literally be ashamed of myself.
I love this sub. So much.
I say we really teach Reddit a lesson and give in to their every demand! That'll show 'em.
Another win and guess what? **WE'RE STILL NOT TIRED OF WINNING!**
It might also help if 98% of the media wasn't constantly bashing him. 
#Goddamn I love this country! The only country in the world where you can so openly and so blatantly smear and censor the commander in chief!
I voted Hillary, a friend of mine voted for Trump. We had an honest discussion about our differences in opinion, none of our minds changed by the end of the elections. We both voted different ways in a swing state, and our opinions towards each other haven't changed at all.   It's dumb really, how can anyone expect to understand more perspectives if they don't even take the time to listen to the things they disagree with? The far left is ridiculously bubbled, and everyone is too comfortable with having their ears shut. That goes double with reddit. I go to /r/politicaldiscussion to hear differences in opinions, I'll argue, but I won't pretend I'm a prestigious prick that's on some imaginary high ground. I gain absolutely nothing if I don't listen to things different from what I think I know.  Shutting people out is like suffocating yourself, you're only really hurting yourself.
Wait what happened???
Said it before and will say it again.  I think much of the behavior on this sub is childish, but that being said it is the only source on r/all for an opposing point of view.  I support your energy on the positive GOP posts...just wish you guys would stop with the childish stuff  
A couple up from this post is "blackpeopletwitter".....and they call us racist? I mean...wtf....  and a couple below is a enoughtrumpspam post ....A subreddit designed to antagonize supporters of the President of the United States of America......and that's ok......  Seriously...why are we coming here?  It's got to be the server usage only....
Either way if/when we go reddit will pay dearly. 
When I went to bed at 12pm Irish time, I was feeling a bit down knowing Hillary would be the next POTUS. I felt that everyone here would be let down and destroyed.  Can you imagine it lads. I wake up to find out ye did it. This movement can't be stopped. Choo
Anything is possible when you characuturize half the country then ban and berate anyone that doesn't fall in line.
MFW Spez says "I have received plenty of support from the users of The_Donald."

I do belive our support goes a little like this:  #FUCK /U/SPEZ
He must be taking our jokes at him as jokes with him.  I hate those kinds of people.
He must think "fuck /u/spez" is a term of endearment.   It's not. Fuck you asshole.
Well, he is a cuck, so he probably doesn't understand what we mean when we run the train on his wife

Want to hurt reddit financially?  Preferences>content options>uncheck "change links into reddit affiliate links" You can also uncheck outbound click logging in the privacy options.  (thanks /u/ygltmht)
if he really thinks we're deplorable, "plenty of support" might be a handful of us- which he might actually consider sufficient to make his point  he didn't qualify it, so we can safely assume that he's not lying- he's just being a total jackass

No he hasn't.  Fuck /u/spez.
I don't support the harassing of the man, but I can't see anyone here actually supporting these tactics..   I'm ok with the sticky mod, but it should be all subs..
Everything they are saying is just the opposite of reality or projection.  All the people complaining we can dish it out but can't take it. Just pure projection. We take it more than anyone else on this site and we deal with it. They're the ones who cry and lie and throw temper tantrums.  Leftism really is a mental disease that seems to fundamentally damage a person's ability to reason or think critically. Shame most of reddit suffer from it.

ITS COOL I CAN SAY THE N WORD I HAVE A BLACK FRIEND
Why the fuck would he get support from any user here? He openly hates us all.

Yeah what was that? What horse shit lol.  They simply don't understand us or what motivates us to support the God Emperor.
I support Spez! Any idea he has to try and pipe down the board that we can crumble apart and make worthless in record time, proving our numbers and tenacity, is completely kosher with me!  C'mon Spez, keep it coming! I never get tired of winning!
Most CEO's who behave like Spez step down.  
u/spez is an insecure cuck of Brobdingnagian proportions. It beggars the imagination that someone could be so dumb, and simultaneously think we are dumb enough to believe anything he says.  Judge a poop tree by its fruits.
Fuck u/spez 
**WRONG**
Yeah what a bunch of nonsense. No one in here supports his nonsense. haha.
**LITERALLY 0.0% OF THIS SUB WOULD SUPPORT WHAT HE'S DOING**  /u/spez you truly are a liar and a creep.  It has nothing to do with politics either, you are just a scumbag.
Good Lord. He has no support for any of this.
If he means section automatic light support, then sure.
I mean, i thought it was hilarious.  I didn't get upset about it until i saw a pede make the point that spez had the power to edit what the president of the USA posts on reddit quite a while later.  
The only thing i support of u/spez is his resignation.
/u/spez [you're having a hard time tonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TakxOKwVJDM)
I think he might be talking about for his resistance to the pressure the default sub mods were putting on him to ban us
It's like saying the people of Cuba loved Castro
/u/spez is a cunt.
Spez, when we say we're willing to fuck your wife, we're not actually being supportive of you or your lifestyle.
Put that face with that exact expression on the forthcoming $45 bill.
I was thinking the same thing. Who from here is writing him saying "way to go spez"?

Actually I made a post saying it was a simple mistake.   Boy was I wrong. I really hate the guy. 
Well he can edit any comment. So yea, he edited support for himself.  ### Edit by spez: I endorse spez.
I'm certain /u/spez planted that in his announcement to rub salt in the wound. Typical passive aggressive behavior you could expect from a teenager.
I supported him when he wrote "fuck u/spez" on his own post...

Would be a SHAME if this REAL photo of a packed President Trump Inauguration Ceremony made it to the front page.
"KKK gets front row seats for inauguration" - CNN
It was probably not as big as Obama's or most other demcorats but like DC, was 91% Hillary.Baltimore and Northern Virigina are also populated with Democrats so obviously not as many people showed up.  
Both the photo sets they showed to push the contrary were blatant examples of forced perspective.
More fake news. The [*real* photo](http://i.imgur.com/F8lE8jg.jpg)
FYI people are saying this is a low angle shot and thus hiding the empty areas. [I made this to show how wrong that is](https://imgur.com/a/gFGqE)
[deleted]
Unfortunately, I had to watch the Inauguration on CNN and I quickly realized they kept showing the same crowd shot of people coming into the in during the ceremony. I was so frustrated and then really glad when I saw some other perspectives of the crowd during his address. I have brushed off this whole #fakenews thing until today. Now I am convinced. 
Wasn't nearly as crowded because the silent majority was working. 
Full disclosure: Not a Trump supporter.  I live in the D.C. area, have seen 9, maybe 10, inaugurations including today. Obama's first inauguration was unusually large; his second less so - but solidly among the larger ones.   It would be unfair to compare ANY inauguration to 2009 - there has not been anything like that in my adult life.  Trump's turnout today was nothing to be ashamed of - it seemed about on par with what I would call an average turnout, the higher end.  Edit: Bill Clinton's 2nd swearing in, was by far the weakest attended IMO. 
I'm proud to have voted for him. No matter what the biased media says. It's ridiculous that they would even claim that no one was turning up. It's like they want the rest of the world to think America is weak. 
[deleted]
OH SHIT. This is bad guys.   #Real Bad  Little known fact, if Trump doesn't have 1.5 million people attend his inauguration, Bernie sanders is immediately elected president in a run off birding contest.
What pissed me off was MSN calling him "Hitlerian" for saying he wanted to put Americans first. Seriously wtf is wrong with the mainstream media?
I was waiting for him to bash the media and say video the crowd!
You should see the r/[redacted] threads today.  They are so desperate to deny reality right now.  I've provided 5 different images from different news organizations showing different angles of this same picture, and they still bury your comments.  It's gotten so bad over there that I am seriously considering filtering that sub so I don't even bother contributing.  I don't want to be in my own little bubble, even if it is with a bunch of fine people like you all... I want to be exposed to other ideas to challenge my pre-conceived notions.  But dammit all, they make it nearly impossible.
The millions of people that got Trump elected are celebrating where it matters. In middle America.   But luckily, just enough showed up to make this an amazing day. Guys..... PRESIDENT TRUMP!
Suddenly the Left tells us the size of Trump's crowds matter.
i thought the ceremony was nice
The reason Obama's was packed was because it was historical, him being the first black president
I was there up in the standing area near the front.  It was packed as far as I could see.  The crowd was super vocal too.  They Booed the Cllintons and Obamas. Started yelling we want trump and drain the swamp while Chuck Schumer was talking. It seems like most of the chants started far back near the Washington Monument and roared up near the stage.  I didn't even notice the white mat things on the ground because there were so many people, there were no mats where I was standing. It was off and on drizzling all day and it was cold. It is crazy being in the crowd but when you watch it on all the videos you can't really hear the crowd.  The highest energy protesters were the militant Jesus squad.  Not sure what they call themselves.  They weren't violent or blocking anything they just had a megaphone near the entrance to the secure zone telling everyone that they are going to hell.  It seems like few BLM tried to block the exit but the crowed started shouting USA USA USA so loud that they backed down and the police were keeping things civilized at the exit I used.  There were a few groups of protesters in the ticket area where I was standing but they didn't do much, their cheers and boos were drowned out real quick.  There was one chick with small handwritten signs that read something like 2 million + majority and #ppp Putin's personal puppet.  She also was shouting something during Trump's Oath but it was so low energy it didn't even register in my mind.  I tried to understand what she said but it is like they fade from reality in the presence of Trumps magnificence.
How I imagined this going from MSM.   "Wow, listen to how quiet that crowd is." "Not as exciting as Obamas." "Let's cut away to rioters bashing in windows of anti-Trump companies."  Oh wait... That's how it went.  Good job MSM. 
[deleted]
But CNN told me the crowds were rather small for an inauguration ceremony?   #**WHOSE LYING HERE GUYS!?**  
Democrats can't win elections, but they win at what REALLY matters – attendance numbers! 
SJW'S are triggered. We're being brigaded. Upvote all pedes!  Hey SJW's. Donald J. Trump is your president. 4 years. Maybe 8 years. Hahahahahahaha!!!!!!!
MAGA 
They are losing their minds on r/politics because Trump used basically a stock inauguration photo on his twitter account...let that sink in!
It took me close to 4 hours to get through one security gate. And you needed to go through two. I was still in front of ten's of thousands of people. It could be so much more packed if the whole setup didn't suck so much
They did this at his rallies too. Taking pictures of these events, before they even start, and then acting like nobody was there. Talk about fake news. 
AMERICA FIRST
The biggest Trump Rally
it's almost like if you take a picture while people are being let in there will be less people than one taken later in the day O_o
I'll be honest, I am no Trump supporter. But that BS pre-Inaug photo they were using before most people had arrived and comparing it to Obama's 2009 picture was just fucking childish. Yes Obama set a record in 2009. But that shouldn't be the point. Respect the incoming President and respect the Inauguration day.
Guys. Our whole platform is honesty right. I think fake news exaggerated the lack of our crowds. But remember what motivates the left to vote. Race. Same reason obama had a bigger crowd
I saw one of the pictures that implied a low turnout. I like to point out that the weather wasn't great, and with the extreme violent aggression of the dems, I'm sure some people chose to avoid it.  Had good numbers anyway. MAGA.
Anyone have a link to this photo? I'm skeptical of it tbh... would like to see it from a source 
literally says he wants to give the power back to the people  >OMG HE'S SUCH A FACIST! REEEEEE!!!!!
MAGA DC
Plus you know. Republicans have jobs
Colbert just pandered the early pic as all the people who showed up, its probably gonna be in most papers tomorrow too. It's going to be a fun 8 years isnt it?
I'M IN THIS PHOTO! THIRD PIXEL FROM THE LEFT!! 
i saw that stupid ass fucking viral picture of it empty and thought to myself: boy this sure does look a lot like fake news. and lo and be fucking hold.  i am so fucking fed up with these piece of shit libtards.
[deleted]
Let them think what they want. They will be onto a new ineffectual narrative by tomorrow anyway
They never did show the crowd. Only the protesters before and after.
Seen fuckers on instagram trying to pull a hurr durr look how small the crowd is on him even tho it was packed godamn I hate the left.
Lefties are getting so triggered by this image...
So where does every body go to the bathroom?
As someone who was stuck at the fire station all day, was the photo this morning SERIOUSLY fake?! That is outrageous!
 Hey /u/tommijones,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
My parents traveled from Richmond, MAGA 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Ha! I knew that picture was fake when I saw it
That's actually really incredible 
Is there a higher quality pic? I'm in here somewhere
Are they counting the innumerable Bikers for Trump that were out forming the Wall of Meat? 
At the ball for military members, Trump kept taking questions from the soldiers overseas, while at his first press conference he told CNN to fuck off.  I think that says it all tbh.  He is willing to talk to anyone, but not if you keep talking shit about him unfairly.  Imagine you were at a bar and someone kept saying bad stuff about you all night.  The annoying fuck at the bar is CNN.  But if you aren't an asshole, Trump has no problem talking to you.
This reminds me of when someone showed up to a trump rally about 4 hours early and said it was completely empty.  
Time lapse video of the entire day today.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdantUf5tXg
Literally Hitler! Reeeeeeeee
Every president no matter whom you voted for deserves to be judged on his own merit over time, these bigots will do anything even destroy the USA to prove that they were somehow right.  I'm done with the lot of them , traitors and terrorists the lot of them!  I'd dearly love to see many of those people that instantly call you a racist or incite racial tensions be charged with hate crimes, the irony would be karma sauce.
That's an awful lot of Russian hackers. 
I was there, it was PACKED
Everyone knows how big it was. It was on live TV. 
#IT'S RAINING LIBERAL TEARS!!!
The reason why Trump´s inauguration looked empty compared to that of Obama is cause his supporters had to go to work. It´ś Friday, and still a work day for most people. 
I was looking at Inauguration turn out for each President because everyone has been going on about how Barry had the biggest turn out. Well I went back and calculated Lyndon B. Johnson had the biggest turnout per American population. I asked my Dad was Johnson was a big starter of all the  lower income promises and promising African Americans the world. Turns out turnout doesn't have a lot to do with competence of president.
/r/redacted is gonna stick with the photo of when they're still piling in, thanks.
AYE WE'RE 1ST ON R/ALL

The left comparing the crowds of the inaugurations is the same lame argument that Hillary won the popular vote. It's the liberals saying you guys might have the power but we are the popular kids and we are better than you. Eff the popular kids. 
Guys, why are we even posting this? You're just giving the left bait. Let's stop focusing on crowd sizes and start to focus on MAGA'ing. 
 https://gfycat.com/MajorMedicalKinkajou 
For comparison, let's see Ronald Reagan's ceremony from a similar perspective:  http://i.imgur.com/69glN2N.jpg  Y'know, that guy fucking every state but Minnesota voted for.  This turnout thing is so obnoxious.
definitely more than the other pics try to portray it as (people were late getting in due to protesters blocking ~10 checkpoints), though still not nearly as many as obama.   shrug, can't be helped and imo that's an unfair comparison anyways. due to the city and burbs being heavily blue, dems will always have that big boost from local attendance, plus obama specifically enjoyed the exciting spectacle of being the "first black president".   and, generally speaking, liberals seem to have a greater fondness for attending public gatherings anyways, like with all their marches and protests. or maybe they just have more practice and cause for attending such events.

Damn so many Russian Bots!  WTF!
The sad part is that the haters and the establishment press will keep running the other photo for years in order to manipulate the average low-information types, and to rally the Democrat base.   It's very impressive that he was able to get such a huge crowd considering the weather has been pretty miserable, and that D.C. is not home to a large number of Trump voters.
wtf, there were literally a hundred or so comments in /[redacted] about how "no one showed up."
Triggered fags are downvoting everything hahaha
Dayum!  Was watching the NBC YouTube livestream at the office, they completely cucked the camera angles.  Shoulda fucking known.  This is YUGE!
Why yes it looks bigly from that angle, by why don't you show the aerial view.
How is there such a drastic difference between this one and the one I saw earlier where it looked empty? Also I've heard that only 250,000 were there and I've also heard 1.5 million! Wth is the truth? God it sucks that the msm pushes fake news to where I can't find out what the truth is!
[removed]
I just made this my Facebook cover so anyone that doubts will see it.
The fact this image and others are buried in downvotes and barely circulated in and out of Reddit kind of pisses me off.  Going to be an interesting 8 years
Fuck the media for having that tower RIGHT fucking there.
I wish I could have been there but don't have the means to travel.
This goes against my confirmation bias beliefs!

Interesting how this photo has so many up-votes but the trolls are showing on top of the comments...
Don Lemon just showed that "fake" early morning picture at 11:30pm. He lied again.
Is there a high definition version of this photo?
Oh shit!
Now CNN is crying about TRUMP not meeting a diversity quota in his cabinet.
Who cares if he did get less than Obama, really? Just look at the partisan makeup of the DC metro area and tell me you'd expect anything else. Fairfax County was against Trump 65-35. Arlington, Alexandria, Montogomery County 75-25. Prince George's County 90-10 (!), and DC itself 95-5 (!!!). How many people have the time and money to get a flight to DC and a hotel just to go to the inauguration? And on a weekday, at that. Not me or anyone I know, at the very least.   If we held inaugurations in Dallas instead, somehow I suspect Obama's turnout would have been a big comedown from Bush. 
But you're from Russia. You hacked the picture. 
Holy shit fuck!
When you realize that this is in D.C where Trump got 4.1% of the vote...
I was just reading on vox that trump attracted relatively few ppl....immediately called bullshit. Didn't even watch the ceremony.
Don't forget that there were many thousands, possibly tens of thousands, that were blocked from getting into the mall by lefty loon protesters/rioters
If you voted for a woman that was under multiple investigations by the FBI, would you downvote this picture of somebody who has never been under investigation by the FBI?
HILLARY CLINTON COULVE BEEN THE FIRST F PRESIDENT!!!   Sorry I was gonna say female...   But someone deleted the emale 😏

Russia = DNC fucking up but conveniently trying to shift blame on the Globalists' worst enemy.  What a coincidence!
I'm a young female, often stereotyped as middle eastern (though I am not), born and raised in Los Angeles, and I voted for Trump. I can't even tell my friends I voted for him because they will shit on my life. R/The_Donald is the only place I can come and read about stuff that I agree with. Thank you!
Everyone that was old enough to remember his election will never forget it. He is the most known person on the planet, no doubt.

I love Trump. He is the first hero of the people of my generation. Ppl will look back in time and realize what a pivotal role he played in the future of mankind. This guy deserves a great statue in the capital eventually. 
Even with the Deep State, Media, and Spying, they still couldn't find anything to stick on our President. You have to be one clean mofo to accomplish that.

Trump is basically a virgin. Without sin as well. True God Emperor.
Any high res version? wanna make it my office wallpaper
According to James Comey, this man is NOT under investigation by the FBI.  Meanwhile, Hillary was or is being investigated by FIVE field offices of the FBI.  Smoke that shit, cucks!

This feels like one of those memes with two buttons. 
Absolutely not!  This is the man who will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!
I wish I could upvote this more than once
As a right-winger who didn't particularly support Trump, this is honestly my opinion as well.    Not only did Comey have no evidence, he came across as biased.    "Did Trump say X"  "No, but I had this feeling"
Side o beef. Nasty woman!!   #YOU KILLED SETH RICH YOU NASTY BEEF BITCH
Does being surveilled count as being investigated?
When the official announcement that Donald Trump will remain President comes through I want to see the liberal tears. Nothing can ever beat the sheer hilarity of the Hillary supporters on election night but I expect this to be quite entertaining and enjoyable as well.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grD_IINiH9c  edit- hahaha, just had to put it into words, been laughing for a while now at this hilarious video.

That'd be a nice desktop wallpaper.  I've had the same one of Trump at the Oval Office desk since October which was just a really well done photoshop.  But this is the real deal.  Desktop wallpaper changed.
I came here to check out the Upvote %.  75% upvoted? 25% salty cucks who go out of their way to come to The_Donald to get sand in their vaginas?   That makes me happy

She's got a new one folks, she's STILL under investigation.  
It is called liberal projection
You know whats sad? all the other political subs are trying their best to spin this testimony to favor their shitty Trump-Russia narrative. Lefty CUCKS will still believe it because why? their too stupid and lazy to actually watch it so they just read the headline, (not the article, the Headline) that fits their narrative.  Its pathetic.

"Putin" is an anagram for "Input", a term used in computing... the same computing that was used to do the hacking during the election... COINCIDENCE?!
I am hearing further rumors that sensible people didn't want an insufferable harridan to attain ultimate power. Putin is one of them.
I think we need a major investigation to find out why the Democrats "reset button" given to Russia and Hillary's big sale of U.S. uranium to Russia is now such a big mistake.  The Democratic party was ready to go to war with Russia even before there were Wikileaks. The Democrats have not offered a meaningful explanation for their massive reversal in Russian policy. Prior to the election, what was it Russia did turn the Democrat's love into hate spitting ire. 
I hate Twitter the company, but there's nothing like a perfectly composed tweet that really hits home, all in 140 characters or less!
**Why havent we nuked Russia 50 times, you might ask?**
**WOULDNT IT BE GREAT IF WE.... GOT ALONG WITH RUSSIA??**
This is what I don't get about the whole thing... of course Russia wants to influence elections so they have the best outcome for Russia. I'm sure they try to hack literally every partys' servers in literally every 1st world country. You know who else tries to influence foreign election? **LITERALLY EVERYONE** The US fucking assassinates democratically elected leaders, yet I'm supposed to be outraged at Russia hacking a server and finding dirt? Do people think China's numerous statements against the anti-China candidate were all a coincidence? Of course China was trying to influence the election. Mexico tried to influence the election. justin trudeau tried to influence the election. Every European leader who spoke about our election had an agenda. But I should be upset that Russia showed us corruption in one of our parties? Progressives should thank Russia becasue now they have the info and ammo they need to clear out some of the establishment.   Not only all that, but there isn't even any proof Russia was the source of the leaks. I'd guess they were, but to this point it's all speculation. Dems just pretend it's true so they don't have to blame themselves for their own stank ass policies that cost them the election.  
I don't know a single Russian / eastern European that didn't vote for, or wasn't pro Trump (if they couldn't vote).  They all saw Clintons policy as too close to the promises made by Stalin, and the fear mongering by the left against some nebulous Russian threat.
[deleted]
Someone correct me if I'm wrong because I haven't read up on this much.  It seems like the corrupt American establishment is upset at Russia (if it was even Russia) for leaking the e-mails that exposed their corruption.  This is similar to being mad at Edward Snowden for revealing the truth about the NSA.  MSM's stance = "Don't get mad about our corruption, get mad at the people who revealed our corruption!!"  Makes sense.  Please someone let me know if I'm missing something.
fucking genius. someone get him a medal
The neo-cons want war in Syria, Iran and Ukraine.
CNN: Trump's decision to not get into pointless wars puts thousands of soldiers out of jobs
These people are so smugly stupid 
Even Russia is tired of this bullshit. But there even is no evidence for tampering.
I just don't get this, aren't dems supposed to be FOR anti war presidents? Also even IF IF IF IF IF the DNC/Podesta emails were leaked by the Russkies, isn't the TRUTH being exposed worth at least acknowledging and realizing that if "Russia" hadn't leaked the Info, we would continue under the rule of psychopaths and pedophiles? Just sayin
If the CIA was actually making the claims the Dems are saying the CIA is making, Donald Trump would be in these conversations as well - and would probably be under investigation for collusion with foreign State actors.  But he isn't.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO GO TO WAR WITH RUSSIA!!!!!!!!  
Avoiding war is now a bad thing?  Who knew?!
It makes sense, Obama has us in more wars and bombing more countries than during the bush era. Liberals are secretly pro war.
And, of course, there is no mention of why Russia would do it (if they even did) in the media right now.   They know that 'Because we didn't wanna go to fucking war with you!' is a pretty convincing answer, so best not mention it.
Is this like tongue in cheek sarcasm?

And if not direct conflict, further [proxy war in Syria was very likely](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/world/middleeast/syria-assad-obama-airstrikes-diplomats-memo.amp.html) (IIRC Clinton sided with those diplomats).
Millions of fucking muslims want our entire existense to die, but clinton and the liberals want to go to war with one of the few european nations who give a shit about this battle
All this Russia fake news is to take attention off of the Clinton Foundation....

I don't think Bernie would have lead to war with Russia. Too fucking weird that they forced the most pro-war bitch in instead. 
All trump had to do to win Russian national support was say "I don't support world war 3". Is that so bad?
I've given up trying to understand why the left is so committed to the cuck game. Now I'm just trying to understand why they get so angry when others refuse to cuck.
American voters supported the candidate that does not want war with Russia.

Whoever leaked Podesta's emails released the TRUTH.   Why is that point never mentioned by the MSM?  Why are they more concerned about WHO released the truth, than the fact that the truth was damning?  Perhaps because so much of the truth showed collusion with the MSM and Clinton?

So it's ok for foreign governments to interfere if they don't like the candidate? So if Trump ever says he's going to go to war with some country, it's ok for them to do what Russia did. You'd have no issue with that?  Fucking retards.

Hmm. Maybe Russia should slow down a little .
Oh yes, let's not fight Russia, let's cause Pakistan and India to nuke each other, and let's get into a war with China, which will raise prices on literally everything and kill tons of people. That's a *great* idea.

It's so funny now whenever I watch YouTube Barack and Michelle Obama have ads URGING people to vote Democrat this year.
He was projecting. Hillary will change a lot, and not in a good way.
Judging by the downvotes, this is a CTR hot topic.
It is now Obama that will say anything to help Hillary get into office.
I voted for Obama twice. I'm sorry for the last 8 stagnant years. 
Holy shit I was just going to deport a shill post and it was already deleted by the time I did it NICE
Let's dispel this notion that Obama doesn't know what he's doing
This is on the top of r/all for me
Probably the smartest thing he's ever said
I think WW3 is definitely a change.
Dunno if it's Obama's real opinion, but it's definitely mine.
# #RememberWhenTrump was called a Liar by Obama and declared not qualified to be president? #OhWaitThatWasHillary
We shouldn't care about his opinion, he is a joke.
And this scumbag fucker "magically" thing Hillary is now qualified. Fuck him 
Trump really should have re-run all these old obama ads. It would have successfully nullified Obamas current position. 
[removed]
I wasn't sitting down for that. Hold on. Okie doke what's he saying now?
Hillary*
Politicians are only honest when talking about dirt on their enemies.
up vote this to the top please.  MAGA
B-but I thought she was the most qualified person to ever run for president?
But haven't you heard, everything she has done since 2008 has made her the most qualified Presidential candidate of all time.
He meant to say most qualified ever, just a gaffe.
Yet this clown is lobbying for Killary. Stupid fuck.
I can't believe Trump never ran an add using only Obama sound bites about Hillary. 
Do you happen to have a source for this? I dislike Clinton as much as the next person but I would also like sources, to legitimize the claim. 
Here's another opinion of Hillary from Obama And Michelle from in the past : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPESWWPUJE
Obama is so narcissistic that he only wants Obama care to live on and he knows that craps getting smashed when TRUMP becomes president! Bad bad bad people , wait can i even call them people?
But now he's campaigning for her. Something's not right here. 
Hollywood / The Presidency = A politician's blurred-line. 
It's from his 2008 campaign Ads. Whether he said it or not, it's the angle their own party was using years back... AND nothing has changed.  https://youtu.be/vGqD8-a-REQ
And according to Obama all of a sudden she's okay.  Politicians disgust me.  
"But he's totally behind her now!!!!!" so either he's a liar or he's an idiot. He can pick which one.
He didn't change anything either, aside from the cost of health insurance.
I canvassed outside polls during the primaries with a sign with this quote. Trump voters took selfies with me, a Clinton voter attacked my autistic son. Let that sink in.  To answer the angry private messages: he was wearing a "Birdie Sanders" sticker and a middle aged lady in a rage made a grab to rip it off of him. She was unhinged as fuck. My son had a fucking 2 hour autistic meltdown (and by autistic meltdown, I mean [this](http://www.autism.org.uk/about/behaviour/meltdowns.aspx))
I have to go post this on r_politics
8 years and what's he done.  I think him dancing with his wife is the only thing that springs to mind. The whole system is broken. A public vote system on everything would be a step forward. All major decisions are decided by the people. Log on show the data, we decide. Not some politicians. If only. Most of them could then go and do proper jobs, won't need hardly any of them. 
Wait... I actually agree with Obama on something?
One of the few times this "man" has ever spoke the truth! 
More proof that Democrats will tell any lie to win.
That's why Obama shills for her. He said everything running for President and changed nothing. Remember, he also said he wasn't on the ballot (thank fuck) but his policies were. Third term Obama in the form of Hillary, anyone?
[deleted]
#ObamaForHillary?
I bet he wouldn't be able to say his true opinions out loud. Thats his watered down verion
This is why I do not respect the Dems. I remember distinctly all the nasty things said back in the 2008 campaign for president back and forth between Obama and Clinton. So much corruption. I hate the commercials lately where Michelle and/or Barack say something along the lines of "vote for my FRIEND Hillary"... when the heck did they become friends? I think politicians just bank on the American people having the memories of 5 year olds.
[removed]
Someone should make a video of him arguing with his 2008 self about Hillary.
Guess they are friends now since Barrack has ended up with the exact same qualities 
Michelle Obama also criticized Hillary. It's funny how these things work, huh?
Don't we have the best memes folks?
Bernie said a similar thing now he's sucking her off. Sad to see that both of these men have no spine at all
Well dumb ass, maybe you shouldn't have given  her the Secretary of State job then.    I guess he got a pretty good payoff for that. 
now Hussein obama is scrambling telling  voters if they want to respect his legacy they need to be sure Trump doesn't win..   Hussein obama's legacy has already been written.   his 8 years of failure will mark his legacy as the Oval Office door slams him in the ass on the way out.. Good riddance 
If a pot smoking, socialist Kenyan bastard can't trust her, who can?
http://www.snopes.com/obama-hillary-clinton-isnt-qualified/
[removed]
We should really be pushing and sharing this kind of thing now while she's depending so much on the Obamas making them look good
Simple Google search will prove that obama never said anything about her not being qualified for president. More disinformation 
**SHE WAS BAD....TILL THERE WAS DIRT ON ME, NOW IM WITH HER**
Sh Sh she she she's uh she's uh changed now guys
Plot twist:  he was talking about himself.
awww yes public n private position 
**Hypocritical** of Obama to say.
I wish the Trump campaign had spammed TV ads of this for the last year. 
Now that's a message that we can all get behind.
HOL ON HOL ON HOL ON HOLD UP HOLD UP HOLD ON HOL ON HOLD UP
Untill he got allowed into their little club...

I dunno how much the centipedes know about this guy but if you haven't seen his appearances on Joe Rogan and Steven Crowder they're pretty good.   It all started from a debate he had with a gender queer, tranny and zir on Canadian TV, which you can find on YouTube.   He's an interesting guy. 
I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Apache” and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can’t accept me you’re a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

"I've studied authoritarianism for a very long time - for 40 years - and they're started by people's attempts to control the ideological and linguistic territory" - DR. BASED PETERSON  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37875695
I can't wait to see Trudeau licking Trump's boots.
Reminds me of that student that identified as "His Majesty" and his teacher had to call him "Your Magesty" every time he talked to him
that's the most stupid law ever created, like wtf canada??
His talk with Joe Rogan is one of the best interviews I've ever listened to
So you're saying that I can get fined in Canada for misaddressing a gender confused person out of 58 gender options? Fuck that.

His podcast on JRE recently was truly mind opening

My pronoun is cuckslayer. 
My pronouns are "Trudeau gargles balls" if you don't refer to me as "Trudeau gargles balls" its discrimination.

I watched this man on you tube , he is very intelligent and does not belong in the cult marx degenerate universities. 
I'm looking forward to the first cases where a mispronouned snowflake has to prove in court that he/she/xhe/ze is actually the gender of preference. I'm looking forward to witnesses who have to judge a photo of said snowflake. 
He's a very smart guy.  Just watched him on the Rogan podcast.  Rogan has been redpilled btw.
I listened to this man talk all night through different videos and podcasts. He's a legit great thinker. This is the kind of person people should be listening too and taking very serious.
Peterson is a hero of our society. someone said he sounded like kermit and he showed he also has a frog hat, gifted to him by his native friends. praise kek.
This is the first step to them creating a full fledge thought police. It won't just be about pronouns, it will be about anyone who offends the left. So if you're attacked and your family killed by an immigrant or terrorist, you could end up in jail for pressing charges.   They are trying to pass this same law in america, which violates the 1st amendment.

I saw a trans man (female to male) get hysterically offended because someone didn't quite know how to address them. This person wasn't trying to be insulting but the transperson decides that the non transperson is a complete asshole for not knowing the correct pronoun. I told the transperson that if they can cut off their boobs and call themselves a man, then they should be able to take it without being a bitch about it. Identify how you want, but it's not other people's problems and it's certainly not their duty to learn each and every pronoun for everyone who decides that the gender they are born as isn't right. 
Check him out on Joe Rogan. It is an AMAZING podcast.   Isn't it strange that my government would charge people for a hate crime for NOT using certain words?  For example. It's not a crime to say the N word, but not saying "Zir" *is*?  Canada, you're becoming a fucking joke. Get that dumb golden retriever Justin out along with that hag, Wynne. Justin has already put us in so much debt, just like his daddy, who nearly ruined us.   Just WAIT till the interest rates kick in. 
I am so embarrassed to be Canadian right now. We got rid of a competent businessman for a drama teacher because of hair.
I would advise everybody to listen to this interview that he gave  it is truly frightening what liberals have turned education into. I think he said it the best with "we are funding revolution with your own taxes. It is idiotic and destructive"   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wyGK6k6HE 
Canada is cucked. The whole western world is dying and only an aged reality TV star with a cool comb over and his supporters stand in the way. When we win they will write about this for generations. It will be called the 'cuck wars'..... Can't make this stuff up.
Holy shit Canada... 
[His interview with Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wyGK6k6HE)
Canada is a fucking meme.
I think these SJWs are going in the wrong direction. If they truly want change and not just grief people why have a different gender pronoun for every (imagined or real) gender there is? It would be much easier to have just one pronoun that doesn't specify the gender like they do in some languages. But I guess rationality isn't in their toolbox.
Canada is cucked.  Source: me, am Canadian.
This is one of the reasons why I want to run for Prime Minister of Canada. We need to get rid of this politically correct culture that has ruined the fabric of Canadian society. Make Canada Uncucked Again! 
If you add weird pronouns to the English language, it's now a different language, let's call it SJWEnglish.  I don't speak SJWEnglish and they certainly can't force me or anyone else to learn that language.
I'm listening to his podcast with Joe Rogan right now - it's fantastic. I have a few book recommendations that Jordan made that I'm going to buy for family for Christmas as well.  The direction my country is headed in really scares me. My niece *actually majored* in Social Justice at the University of Toronto - I couldn't believe that was a major.  She works entry-level at a bank now, a position she got through her parents' friend, so I find that ironic in my own little way.
Canada, what a socialist fucking nightmare.  Freedom of Speech is a reportable crime.  What a nation of looneys. 
I don't think Dr. Peterson gets enough credit for what he's doing. This is the University of Toronto here, i.e. The Swedish Embassy of Canada. It's the land beyond cucking.  He's almost certainly alienated all his peers and most of his friends. There aren't many woke people in Toronto.
Is freedom of speech not a thing up there?
[deleted]
If that law goes through, I'm OUT OUT OUT!  (legally)
This is one of those times that I am actually happy to live in Quebec.  But seriously - this needs to stop.
I thought it was already a law to use it's pronoun.  I have a Canadian discord friend that said it went through a monthish ago. 
Jordan has been making the rounds on some popular podcasts lately. He has gone on Joe Rogan, Crowder, Rubin, Callen, etc.   I really like his self-authoring writing module he made. You write about your past experiences , present ideas, and future goals.  It's really interesting and useful for anyone who wishes to improve themselves.   I don't agree with Jordan on everything, but he has a lot of interesting and helpful information to offer. 
Relevant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGpZSefYvwM Watch Canadian government workers play into a woman's delusions, just because she says she wants to be identified as a male *for government purposes*. End result: Lauren Southern is now legally a male because she *felt like it*.
If u got a dick ur a he 🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆
My pronouns are Lord/Sir/God, and in Canada it will soon be illegal not to refer to me by these.   Fucking insane.
1. Male ("he")  2. Female ("she")  3. Hermaphrodite (either is fine)  4. Asexual ("it")  That's it. Anything else and you're a mentally ill freak.
My good god, you pronoun warriors are such pussies. 
But I'm a WHITE FUCKING MALE CENTIPEDE I will not allow them to confuse my CENTEPEDE LIKE GENDER 
This is crap. I can assume anyone's gender, if you get offended, guess what I don't care. If you live you life, why are you offended ?just be yourself, who cares. Be proud of who you are, stop being sad about yourself and stop listening to other people, be confident that you are you....  Next it will be illegal to call someone "names" which is short for free speech, fuck off.
'member when liberals used to stand for tolerance?  /r/the_donald 'members
If anyone wants a great discussion with him check out his joe rogan interview. It's the best joe rogan interview in a while. Some of the things he says about Canada are truly shocking.
If they want it to be criminal that I don't know what the duck some other person wants to be called than that fuck head is required to wear a big fucking sign around their neck saying what they want at all times. Fuck this horse shit so goddam much. Like fuuuuuuuccccckkkkkkk gender pronouns anyone I know older than 30 has no fucking clue what any of this means and where it came from. Just some more social media bs spewing into the real world.  *fuck
A CRIMINAL OFFENCE!??!?  Is Canada completely retarded?
As a Canadian who is fed up with this shit I am sincerely rooting for this guy. Unfortunately, we have a mostly liberal leadership right now and this will most likely go through. If it does however, I am changing my "preferred pronoun" to "Your Highness ".
Hear what is going on from Jordan B Peterson himself. Watch the debate. His lively hood has been threatened many times over. People are commenting saying the Bill doesn't say any such thing. In his latest video he details how the social justice tribune can charge him with a hate crime. I really suggest everyone do a little more research on this topic and not just simply insult the far left. https://www.youtube.com/user/JordanPetersonVideos/videos
Yes let everyone pick their own gender pronouns like a personal pan pizza at pizza hut, THAT will fix their issues of not feeling any self worth or engaging in a useless college major. Letting people change their pronouns isn't the solution, getting them to  figure out why they're so unhappy is. But no canada, keep pandering, keep pandering. See how that plays out for eveyone. I figured this bill would die fast and easy, guess Canada's more fucked than I realized.
This is how thought policing starts.
Fellow Red-Pilled Canadians, We must stand against the SJW menace that infests our great nation. We must stop this law from happening. Our Freedom Of Speech is under attack! We must defend our rights! 
It KILLS me that this is the only subreddit that cares about this issue.
Everyone knows that there are only THREE genders...  Male,  Female, and Retarded.
We must support Dr. Peterson! What Canada is proposing is utter lunacy- the kind of legitimization the insane SJW cucks are searching for...
how stupid are they
This man is brilliant. I remember watching a video of him speaking at the University of Toronto. He somehow managed to get most of the students on his side, it seemed. I hope he gets more attention. We need somebody like him.
I'm surprised, Canada is partially French, and the French love their language.

The man is brilliant who stands up for the right reasons; no matter your political beliefs.
I'm Canadian and I even disagree with this shit. Like come on 
Everyday Canada gives me a new reason to be ashamed of it. So fucking glad I married an American woman. By the time Trudeau is done you will need a new wall to keep out us frostbacks. 
I propose we accept Canadian refugees who won't accept this silliness. 
This is really important. We don't want this to be set as a president across the world. That's how it becomes normalized and then infects YOUR country. 
This is fucking absurd. I'm a transwoman, and if you purposely call me a he, I will be offended. But it's your right to offend me and be an asshole. Freedom of speech also comes with the freedom to be an asshole.

Trans person here (though not a Canadian).  This is fucking stupid, these cucks love to legislate morality.  It shouldn't be their problem if someone gets my pronoun wrong accidentally

This guy is a beast. Recently interviewed by Tom Woods on his podcast a couple of times. Episode 800 was the latest one. http://TomWoods.com/800
Bad things happen when you let the bastard son of Fidel Castro run your country.
Just wondering, are they going to start banning music, literature and film unless it uses gender neutral language? I mean what do they do when ZZ-Top comes on the radio? 
It's official, I have 0 fucking reason to go to Canada. I was really looking forward to going on a stripper safari in Montreal for a buddies bachelor party, but I guess I'll have to go with Texas. Going to Vinnie's Clubhouse will probably be more fun for him anyway.

Fuck this shit imma move to the U.S. so Trump can be my president.
This and Trudeau's Castro statement are making me so fucking embarrassed to be a Canadian right now.
Criminal offense? Are you fucking serious?  Wow bye bye Canada, stupid cuck government will get you nowhere. 
I wrote Canada off years ago.
The only winners will be the lawyers who will profit from the plentiful billing hours from frivolous lawsuits about pronouns.
This is perhaps the best explanation of the inherent ridiculousness of gender pronouns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG1GE3pCSgg  IMPORTANT NOTE: The issue is not with the LGBT community, the issue is the use of LEGISLATION to prevent free speech.
People think Mexico is bad, Canada is worse! Canada is like Panem from the Hunger Games. Looks lovely from the outside, but if you don't fit in and become part of the hive mind, you're thrown in jail.
He should move to America where under a trump administration this bs won't happen as much or at all

Every 4 years cucks like to say that Reagan wouldn't be welcome in today's GOP. They cranked it up to 11 over Trump.  Reagan would have been the centipedest centipede. He wouldn't have agreed with Trump about everything but we're not cucks we prize having independent minds instead of toeing the Politburo line 100%. He spent his whole life pre-Hollywood among the deplorables of the Midwest and he never forgot them or the common man in general once he became a celebrity. He never abandoned his past the way so many do when they go to Hollywood.   Ronald Reagan would have been in the first row of Trump supporters against the self-proclaimed aristocracy. He loved to BTFO the hubris of cucks.

#####Well, the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they are ignorant, but that they know so much that isn’t so.

The greatest conservative, the greatest leader, the greatest fear of the Left and the greatest president. Poland and the whole Eastern Europe will never forget that you brought us freedom from the tyranny against all odds and when everybody laughed at the whole idea of the fall of communism. Although I never lived in that time, I'm really proud that finally there was someone who cared about few little countries in the middle of the Europe. I hope Donald Trump will be as great as you.  Thank you for all and Happy Birthday Mr. President!
Wow, I totally forgot today was his birthday! I even marked it in my calendar so I wouldn't forget...   Reagan is one of the best Presidents this great nation has ever had. Thank you for posting.   
Happy Birthday to greatest of my lifetime.  
*Runs to see if this is on r/all.*  It is!
Reagan was Trump v1.    My god, Republicans loathed Reagan so much that they ran a third party against him in 1980.    Reagan had the least number of congressional, gubernatorial and newspaper endorsements until Trump shattered that record in 2016.  I guess 20 years from now, Trump will be worshiped by the GOP.   Happy 106 Ronnie.

C'mon, clearly you guys aren't educated or else you'd know what a bad president Reagan really was 
"And whatever else history may say about me when I'm gone, I hope it will record that I appealed to your best hopes, not your worst fears, to your confidence rather than your doubts."  For me he's the greatest modern President and also the guy who finally BTFO the Soviet Union and enabled my part of the world to return to freedom and democracy. Thank you!
I'm a liberal and I upvoted this because I hate communism.
Simple -- he was a Republican.
While I don't agree with everything the man did, he sure knew how to run the economy
I know its the mans birthday but I dont think we should forget the critisisms of his government and events such as the Iran-contra affair
I've always been very happy knowing I was born exactly 70 years after Ronnie, to the day.   Even better, we share the same birthday with my cat. So Ronnie turns 106, I turn 36, and my cat turns 9 today.
lol, he seemed like a nice guy but he was a pretty meh President. Seriously, I mean... All the corruption, The cluster fuck that was "the war on drugs", his stance on Labor Union's, I mean the Iran Contra alone was a complete shit show, he also sold weapons to.... Saddam lol, and he didn't do anything when Saddam used Sarin against the poor Kurds, he totally ignored the AIDS epidemic, he invaded Grenada to take the attention away from the Marine Barracks Bombing in Beirut that left over 200 people dead.   That's just a bit of the standout epic fails by Reagan. He had many so....Yeah. Sorry, GOP'er fanboys. Truth hurts.    Also, as I keep saying, Trump IS NOT a Republican, he's just a Machiavellian infiltrator and usurper of the party. And thank God he is, The Golden Toad is destined for greatness. But he's no Republican. He probably felt indifferent about Reagan.    Trump has done more for pax American in 2 1/2 weeks than Reagan, or any other NWO shill POTUS, in our nation's history. Trump is real, legit, Americana. Reagan was just another confused, incompetent, out of touch dude playing POTUS.    **Truth**   (Better than Obama tho, lol)  
It's the Alzheimer's, he just forgot. 
I don't get the love for Reagan, he had several bad policies that still linger today. He exacerbated the drug war amnestied millions and helped create al Qaeda. Reagan also kicked off the globalist policies that led to Trump, he had a few good stances but far from greatness.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HERO
These people downvoting are so unbelievably filled with hate.  Fuck you and fuck everything Liberalism.  You're a cancer to Western Civilization.
Reagan and Trump share a lot in common only difference is that Reagan has had experience in political office and I heard he was loved by democrats in California remember he comes from a cucked state!
Both the Gipper and Babe Ruth have birthdays today, truly a great day in american history 
Happy Birthday.  If you are in Eastern Europe reading this, the biggest reason why you can read this is because of him.  If you are in the military and you are in some super vehicle, probably because of him as Carter didn't fund it.
Happy birthday, Gip. 
It's my birthday today too :O

Landslide Ronnie...  49 of 50 states in 1984...  525 electoral votes.  We will never see one like that again...  Search "Morning in America" commercial for nostalgia if you are as old as me...
Let me make this clear, gang: Reagan... wasn't my favorite. I respect the man, he was principled, and I never got the notion that he was another crooked, lying politician. His optimism was incredible, he had a penchant for getting things done and bringing people together, and he knew how to throw his weight around when he needed to. Obviously, his handling of the cold war was his defining moment, and he rightfully has earned a core spot in American history for bringing that dreadful epoch to a close. I'm proud of Ronald Reagan, and have no doubt he made us a *lot* better as a nation.  ...That said, remember that *no one* hit the mark 100%. I am a Trump supporter and a white man, but I care about black people, just like many of you do. Like many of us, I have black friends - intelligent, caring and contributing black friends. But Reagan is the architect of the prison-industrial complex... ironically, Clinton raised its walls. Between the Dixiecrats of the 1960s and the Reagan era, blacks were hopping between parties, but radically moving left because of Martin Luther King Jr.'s affiliation with JFK and LBJ.   God bless Ronald Reagan, but I think our party isn't nearly as diverse as it should be because of many of his policies.  *That* is where we come in. We're making America great from the plains of Nebraska to the inner cities. In the few areas Reagan fell short, this movement will rise up and finish the work.   You get guys like Morgan Freeman and Steve Harvey to be hopeful for a Trump administration and you know something good is going on. 
Ronald "Let's help god-fearing muslims like Osama Bin Laden in their fight against godless commies, it won't surely blow up in our faces" Reagan.
Reagan was an abslutely great president. We are stll thankful for him overe here, since he prevented the Russians to invade our country, where we were leading the ressistance against the occupiers and oppresors.  And the Soviet Union falling apart along with the end of Communism were very nice extras.  Oh and we have a statue of him on the opposite side of the us embassy in warsaw. And the statue wasn't forced... Unlike countless other soviet statues

How about because he is implicated in the Franklin coverup?  http://www.voxfux.com/features/bush_child_sex_coverup/franklin.htm
Win one for the Gipper. 
Because he signed as much gun control legislation as he could get his hands on, that's why. Not only that, he came out of political retirement to lobby swing states to favor the 1994 AWB. Because those states went in on the anti gun side, the ban was passed. RR is no hero of mine.
Because he committed treason with Oliver North during the Iran-Contra scandal. Also created a pointless war on drugs that has done nothing but waste money with few to no accomplishments. Led the charge to privatize prisons and punish people instead of rehabilitate. Kicker is still that he committed treason, pinned it all on Oliver North who he then pardoned...... 
Because of Reaganomics, trickle down economics, Iran-Contra, kinda decimating the black community inadvertedly*, some naughty deregulations. The list can grow im sure

I certainly agree with the world being better off without the USSR. On the other hand, I was under my desk at the time. I failed to find the humor in the world's most powerful leader "joking" about nuclear war.
Reagan made the whole country a safe space. And the liberals hate him for it.

People post naked butt holes and exposed vulvas on Reddit? I had no clue.   I spend 99.999% of my time on the_donald.   
>mock fat people  Nope. FPH was one of the more prominent subs banned.
Don't forget threats of violence and death can be said against us without any repercussions at all but we'd be banned if we said half of what was said about us.

Being a conservative in current times is the punk Van Halen thing to do, so it makes sense why the system is trying to keep us down.
..and used to have  a support sub for pedophilia as well.  Nasty site folks
Yeah its ok to be a degenerate piece of filth, but if you're a white male who loves his country....oh shit...better warm up that ban hammer.
There are literally subreddits for sexy abortions, dead children, sex with dogs, animal cruelty, and extreme gore. Then there are subreddits like that for socialism, whose users support violence on "facsists" and "nazis", but of course the Trump supporters are more dangerous. I hate the altright, but their ban was ridiculous. https://youtu.be/5zOvzvXg9ZA 
I've notice that. I mostly lurked on this sub, but once I wrote a sentence I was immediately banned from another sub-reddit I have never gone to. What's up with that?

Why has NO ONE posted about the fact Drew Carey's 11- year-old son Carter started a fire outside the Deploraball riot. That just got swept up under the rug didn't it...
Reddit needs neutrality. EDIT: Reddit as a whole needs neutrality (i'm looking at you, admins.) but political subs like this one are ok.
Yup, I responded to a comment about a guy saying he wished our commander in chief would not be biased. I pointed out that Obama only went to the podium when someone was shot, without any evidence or facts of their innocence, but when it came to our military or anyone white, he was silent.   I only got down voted and ignored.

-reddit bans fatpeoplehate  -posts mocking the weight or appearance of donald trump go to the front page, no problem  -/r/atheism mocks catholics daily (you have to wonder, why dont they criticize islam...it's objectively the shittiest religion with regard to human rights)  -but if you criticize islam, you're islamophobic  double standards sure are fun!
Any pro trump post I've made is immediately down voted. 
As a christian on reddit, but anti christian attitude on this site is really annoying, but what ever its why I only go to certain subs now.

But those things don't hurt anyone.  Any Trump-related or anti-PC rhetoric literally threatens people's lives, just look at the Quebec shooting and Dylann Roof!  -someone I'm arguing with on /r/[redacted]
I've said it before, and will continue saying it when this comes up:   Pizzagate was banned because 'someone might get hurt'. Meanwhile, the PedoChat and PedoFriends subreddits just had to switch to invite only, so they can continue having harmless discussions about raping and abducting children.   Good job, Reddit.
Not even a trump supporter but I agree. Wasn't voat a thing only a couple years ago for Ellen Paige doing this exact thing? Then she stepped down and Steve said that he wanted free speech minus illegal/illicit subs gone. Makes sense to me. Then fast forward a few years later and he's doing more censoring then Ellen ever dreamed of doing.   For all the bullshit circle jerk that occurs on Reddit mocking tumblr for echo chambers and Facebook for fake news you'd think that people would notice the hypocrisy. Instead of talking about the differences and learning how other people feel they just turn Reddit into more of an echo chamber. Makes me sad that there really isn't anywhere to go on the internet where people can express their views without being overly criticized for having them.

Same thing that ruined Something Awful where they made fun of 9/11 on 9/11.  Say anything conservative there and get banned. Eventually everyone left. 
Reddit has hosted a sub for the past SEVEN YEARS dedicated to techniques and tips on shoplifting.  Let that sink in.

I got banned from r/offmychest after I commented that I was a Trump supporter in an otherwise appropriate comment. The moderator wouldn't admit that was the reason. It's ridiculous how intolerant people can be. 
I'm not even a trump supporter i'm just on /r/all and I happened to see this post. All the censoring is a bunch of bullshit. People should be able to speak there minds and share there opinions on reddit. Reddit has just turned into a shitstorm, i don't see it getting any better tbh.
I have noticed a lot of cucks in our sub here doing some trolling the past few days..... 
This is 100% legit, the hypocrisy of this site is astounding. 
Welcome to Reddit, where the popular vote is made up and the electoral points don't matter.

At least this sub doesn't try and censor me.  It's like The_Donald is the only place left on reddit where people can talk freely.
reddit is such a shit hole.
/r/redacted is like a parody site.  Just a list of butthurt.
You can't mock fat people any more. Banned subs.  Funnily, they kept anti-black subs for weeks after...  Admins had to protect their own feelings above all else I guess.
lets just be honest, this is a reflection of "safe space" culture that is so prominent in society these days.  everyone wants to live in their own little bubble, where their views are not challenged, and everyone is a special snowflake that is never wrong and the authority on everything they dislike.  controversial opinions are removed because well, there is no time for discourse, any facts you dislike are purged/ignored.  it isnt just reddit, it's facebook, even google search results have bias.  you see, part of being an adult is facing criticism.  if you dont like what I say, you can disagree: and that's okay!  you can't just ignore what you don't like, or censor it/delete it cause you want to push a specific narrative on social media, or whatever.  that's bullshit, and that isn't free speech.  people say /r/the_donald is an echo chamber, no it isn't.  you know what this place is?  it's one of the few places left where conservative leaning people can talk about conservative ideas, without being deleted/downvoted/purged.  cause in case it wasn't obvious enough, this is a liberal website.  the people who run the website are liberal.  that's fine, but at least allow both sides of a conversation to take place: you cant just remove arguments you dislike, that's censorship a la China.  and obviously, not free speech.  I don't care if you dislike trump.  I respect your right to say whatever you want.  but you know what, you should respect my right to have an opinion too.  and on reddit, that should mean BOTH sides are heard.  not censorship to push an agenda.  cause that isn't right.  but whatever.  media tried this during the election, and we all saw how well that panned out for hillary clinton.  in the end, you cant force people what to think.  if that were true, trump would have been crushed at the polls.  that didn't happen, did it?

Yes this is too true and not trying to jump on any kind of hype train. I go to other subs that mock our president and I don't even try and start a fight. I just ask a question or try to come off as polite as possible and I can't even participate because the mods can tell I lean right. 
Upvote through the damn roof!

I believe /r/altright was banned for doxxing people, /r/*The*_Donald refrains from harassment, that's why this sub is still chillin

The Independent is owned by a Russian oligarch, [Alexander Lebedev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebedev) and they have pro-Russia propaganda, but they are also rabidly anti-Trump and also anti-Putin.  Mr. Lebedev's Wikipedia page says he a socialist and [RT says](https://www.rt.com/business/russian-billionaire-nominates-1-year-old-son-aeroflots-bod-500/) he was a commie from 1979 to 1991.

*"People are saying" + whatever bullshit we want to run with*    Those are some fine journalistic standards you now have over there...
How do liberals not see the obvious and blatant hypocrisy. It is almost childlike. Trump doesn't blindly accept the results before the election like any sane person - make him seem like undemocratic Hitler.   Then after DNC loses election - throw a tantrum and ask for a recount in every major state they lost, even the ones by a landslide. 
Sometimes I wonder if there's a guy at these publications who's like "Hey, maybe we shouldn't run an article completely contradicting ourselves two weeks later, regardless of politics."  That guy is definitely stuffed into a locker somewhere at the Independent's headquarters. 
Oh god, this is the worst. I'm pretty liberal and actually voted for Hilary, but Trump clearly won the race. Between stuff like this and complaints about the electoral college, it's amazing to see people trying to rationalize her loss. They can't accept the fact that she was a terrible candidate. I wonder if these same people would complain if Trump won the popular vote and Hilary won electoral? No way! God the DNC was so pathetic this year, they were PROVEN to have rigged the democratic primaries in Hilary's favor, and they thought people would still blindly vote for her. I hope this election was a wake-up call, but I doubt it will be. :(

Surprisingly, it didn't get voted well, but the replies were great.  >It's so cute when people try to impress Trump supporters with facts.  And of course, more about statistics and facts that prove it can't be rigged:   >I love all these articles with well reasoned and logical explinations of why the things he's saying are bullshit. >The only problem being that in order for them to have an effect on the intended targets things like 'logic' 'reason' 'statistics' 'facts' etc. would have to matter to them... which they don't.

How the hell does anyone trust the news anymore...
I was just looking into The Independent yesterday because I kept seeing their posts at the top of /r/[redacted]. Honestly, the only shittier rag I've seen this election cycle is Vox.  It's owned by ex-KGB Alexander Lebedev: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent  [Who is bros with Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebedev#/media/File:Vladimir_Putin_7_May_2002-4.jpg).  > Lebedev used to own the Moskovski Korrespondent, but according to Channel 4's Dispatches programme, Lebedev closed it down "for political reasons after it published a spurious article about Vladimir Putin having an affair with an Olympic gymnast half his age."

Double standards.  Hillary's email scandal disqualify her.   Hire Podesta who has been convicted.  
"Scientists have proved"
hahahahaha   anyway: scientist. this right here is how you know its propaganda. this only makes sense. by using a completely meaningless word in this context (a scientist of what? who? etc) they are merely trying to pretend that academia (progress) is on their side...  even though through their own words they show how little they understand such matters
It blows my mind how Hillary supporters  continuously blow up /r/politics with anti-trump posts, when hypocrisy is prevalent in practically every stance in which they support her. Hell, they've even stooped so low as to create subreddits directly aimed at attacking us (enough trump spam) and even allow people to filter us out of /r/all. People are mad that they lost and refuse to grow up and accept the fact that President Trump can actually do some great things for this country.

So complaining about the rigged election before it happened was just more 4-D chess, right?
The MSM is now hiring gender studies majors as reporters.  OK if you haven't gradated yet or dropped out.  Just need to know what people are saying and report it.
Think they use the same climate scientists to figure out election fraud?  Probably, the gov't throws enough money at any research group to get the results it wants
I heard a from a "stranger" that I met on the local trail, that this election is now rigged.  *This comment has not been edited in this Pence Timeline
Not really. It's just two opposing opinions put forth in one publication. I'd call that unbiased, to a certain extent. 
Anyone got the links to the original tweets?
I heard this somewhere once,  #If liberals didn't have double standards they would have no standards at all.
No evidence to back up any of your claims? Blame it on the hackers, no problem. For extra juice, make them Russian.   This fake news problem is going to be pretty hard to tackle when so many big players are the worst offenders. 
It isn't really a double standard if it IS the standard.

We need to ask our leaders (chosen or not) how they came to their conclusions which led to their actions.  
Hey u/spez, what you gonna do when The_Donald is bigger than reddit?  You can edit our posts but you cannot edit destiny and we just keep on winning! The train just gets faster and faster cos omfg no brakes!  Seriously though, this is some really bad stuff that's going down, but we are going to win anyway. However, we cannot be complacent.
Selective enforcement of the rules is the definition of corruption/tyranny.  
All I can hear is crying when I read his post.    
More ConTROLLL cucks fuck u/spez do something good for once like promoting free speech instead of attacking the heart of our nation.  Until then fuck u/spez!!
We need a sticky that helps /r/the_donald users completely demonetize themselves from this site.  It is simply a convenient medium to communicate with eachother on.  No ad revenue, no buying gold, they can take a flying fucking leap.  /u/spez is such a cucklord
Butthurt liberals choking on their tears.
/u/spez is a fucking commie
"from warnings to **timeouts**.."  **LMAO** 
I upvote every single post anyway and always have. I genuinely love every post on the donald, so I upvote. Glorious isn't it?
[deleted]
/u/spez needs to learn how apologies work
If people can filter /r/all when they don't want to see this domreddit's posts, who cares if the stickies make it to /r/all or not? This was clearly a power play from /u/spez.  Still, we ought to take a deep breath and remember:  # WE WON THE MOST IMPORTANT BATTLE OF ALL ON NOVEMBER 8TH  This is a minor setback in comparison. We won't be silenced, and we will keep on winning.
Can a cuck be more cuckier than this cucking cucker Edit: I can't spell
Bruh you need to charge your phone
I feel like the "toxic users" would actually trolls who want to make T_D look bad.  Oh well.
i guess we should stop using the sticky
Apparently, the truth is antagonistic now.
LOW SINCERITY
Yeah, his leaked chat logs showed he was **real sorry** and **totally** working to make Reddit an inclusive place for t_d.
Fuck /u/spez.
"I hope thee changes improve your experience on Reddit." Yes, /u/spez, banning stickies will improve everyone's experience on reddit. God forbid the door to the echochamber (r/all) be opened. 
/u/spez is a coward.
What a cockmeat
What are stickies
And that, lads, is what pussy smells like...
Make a new subreddit?
I hope you and your entire lineage die of cancer, you cuck /u/spez
What a fucking joke. There's plenty of subreddit that are toxic shitholes but I wouldn't wanna be a pussy and censor them. Fuck this guy.
Your actual screenshot contradicts your statement.
Well that's a serious algorithm change.
all i read was bunch of self aggrandizing drivel with sjw buzzwords like toxic sprinkled in here and there.

CHARGE YOUR PHONE!
He doesn't want America to be great again. He'd rather spez it to ashes.
"I'm so sorry for messing up. I'm so sorry I got out of line. It's all my fault guys I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have done it. Oh by the way we're censoring the Donald because of it"  Little bitch is embarrassed from acting like a child and we're the ones who called him out on his foolishness so he punishes us. Steve Huffman got bullied A LOT in high school, believe me. 
He mentions going after toxic members. Is anyone aware of anyone being banned or threatened?
What if everyday T_D directed everyone to a different sub to post.  I don't know enough about this, but would he then have to stickie all the other subs??
I love how the #1 post on reddit right now is from enoughtrumpspam, This month has been the biggest cry-baby fest I've ever seen. but hey, Enoughtrumpspammers, You've gotta call Donald Trump your president for the next 4 years. Kiss kiss, little snowflakes. <3
This troublesome user thinks spez is a cuck.
The only way to get rid of that pedophile is by hitting reddit in the wallet  How do we make the shekels stop flowing to this shithole?
So he pretty much said sorry not sorry
I am starting to think this /spez character is a real dick...j/k.  He's always been a dick...you are what you eat!!
It wasn't an apology, he's just sorry he got caught 
Saying a prayer before bed tonight, that I may be one of the top toxic users....  You faggot piece of shit, u/spez
eeewwwww. I hate when people use the word "frequent" as a verb.  You suck /u/spez!
>While I intended no harm, that was not the result.  I think u/spez does not think the meaning of "harm" is what it really means. 
Probably because most subreddits sticky posts very occasionally. You guys do it everyday.
While that will work it will suck for AMAs cause they automatically censored by the /u/spez cuck algorithm.  Apply the rule to all the subreddits you cuck /u/spez!

It's already blocked or locked?? Btw toxic??? I suppose the truth is toxic to those liberals... Makes there tiny heads implode
Dead sub?
/r/the_deplorables
That's president trump to you!
Both him and the power mods make these claims while never showing any evidence. I'm not saying it has never happened but they never actually prove it has happened.  Spez: Reminds me of the muh Russians narrative.
The hidden edit of a user post proves that evidence can be fabricated. No fucking integrity. Unreal.
Sure sounds like a witch hunt, doesn't it?
"Toxic" is like when the media talks about Trumps "rhetoric"  When you ask them exact examples they stammer and shut up and just say "WELL ITS BAD RHETORIC!!!"    The reason is because if they came out and identified exactly what counts as toxic they would look like a bunch of pussies because chances are toxic means just having a far right viewpoint or telling the truth about stuff they don't like.   Toxic is just another buzzword to avoid providing any specifics to back up your opinion. 
Basically they are just going to ban whomever they please and use that 'identification' as a justification for it.
He's already proved he can silently edit posts and he can never prove that functionality isn't there again, other admins have confirmed they can cheat upvotes if they want to, and no powermod will ever show actual evidence of the supposed unending harassment they receive for any reason anyway.  SPEZ: Not only did he prove he can edit posts, he proved he *will* edit posts if he's mad about something.

Doesn't it generate revenue just using the site? Seems like it would make more sense for Reddit to lose hundreds of thousands of users and move to another platform like voat 
The cuck wants to feel in control. 
Ditto

It's locked right now but by choice to avoid splintering the community.  But I mean if it was to be unlocked for a few days a week to allow organic upvotes for original spicy content well. 
The Left loves their Lists.
Not necessarily.  I mean I don't know if Reddit has deals where they show how many visitors come to their site and sponsors give money according, but typically Reddit makes money off ad revenue and Gold.
I agree
Yes. If you organically upvoted these to the front page, then you wouldn't be complaining right now...
No. If it has been stickied at all, it won't go up.

Milo Evacuated - The Tolerant Left in Action!
Good work pepper-spraying a young girl because she had a hat on that you did not like....  https://twitter.com/janeygak/status/826998516144697344

Gay (flamboyant, even) public speaker visits UC Berkley and they riot in anger to the point he has to leave.    Err.. maybe you guys are right. This really is an alternate timeline. 
UC Berkeley is a sanctuary campus...unless you are a gay Conservative
University charges Milo a security fee.  University chooses to allow riots and not provide security.  Progressives still don't understand why Trump won.  Its called law and order.
the irony is TOO MUCH for these people to grasp. UC Berkeley. the birth of the free speech movement. what a joke and an embarrassment.
Glad Milo is safe.  Very brave of him to continue to speak given how violent the left has become
UC Berkeley alums: please exercise the power of the purse and tell the college you WON'T be donating until they stop supporting literal fascism.

This shit is getting super fucking old.
These protestors don't even realize that they are simultaneously making themselves look bad and making Milo more famous
BERKELEY STUDENTS RIOT AGAINST GAY SPEAKER
Building right behind them has a rainbow flag, when they just used violence to take rights away from a gay dude.  Liberalism is a mental disorder.
CNN fake news covered this. Anderson pretended to not know who ANTIFA was and asked "are the ((protestors)) w/ black masks students?"..... Anderson do you take people for fucking fools? Fucking CIA propagandist.
I watched a woman give an interview with her MAGA hat on and said as long as the protest is peaceful she doesn't see anything wrong with it: then got pepper sprayed by a protester. Saw two men get knocked out and beat in the middle of the street while people chanted "Beat his ass! Beat his ass!" They beat one of them while he was out cold and police were nowhere to be found. All because of there is different opinion in the crowd. And the left continues to try and frame themselves as the tolerant ones. Only if you are tolerant to the same ideas as them.The left continues to act like they are the champions of free speech. Only if you think like them. Keep it up intolerant left, 2018 is just around the corner.   Video of the pepper spray incident - https://twitter.com/janeygak/status/826998516144697344  Beat down in the street - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BZvhYkB4xo

Big win for Milo, this is being covered (in some cases begrudgingly) by cable news networks.  Good work rioters. 
They are showing the fires on Fox News right now. These kids have no idea how stupid they are. The lefts MO: suppressing the speech or ideas of anyone that doesn't think like them.
President Trump to end all federal funding of UC Berkley. Bye bye leftist, sanctuary shithole.
Using violence and intimidation to silence someone based on their political beliefs? This is the textbook definition of TERRORISM.  
[deleted]
So, as I said before. Red-pilling. Here's what I'm talking about...    >They rioted, set fires, and assaulted people according to what im reading.  WTF is happening to the left. What the fuck. What. The. Fuck. Violence and riots. "they're punching nazis. It's ok" BULLSHIT. I have been called a nazi by you assholes. I voted for Clinton. I voted for Obama. I argued with my father to convince him to see why gay marriage is important and necessary.  I'm done. I'm out. I'm off the team. Fuck. It.  And fuck the tantrums and the protests and the childish bullshit and the violence and calls for violence. And the puns on your protest signs.  And the selfies at the protests and the fake news and the exaggerated bullshit.  I have seen no pragmatism, no rational thinking. My Facebook page is status after status of how much you hate your own countrymen. Fights about NOTHING with 50 heated comments in a chain. Is he a Russian agent? Did he piss on women? No? Oh what now? Is his cabinet filled with KKK members?  NO THINKING FOR YOURSELVES. LOOK AT YOUSELVES.  If our ideology is so WEAK that an obvious troll illicits riots and fires and Beatings at a fucking university, where we are supposed to be exposed to PROVOCATIVE ideas that challenge us, how strong is it really?  Fuck it. It's been a long time coming. I'm out.  Edit: because it is just so hard to believe that the actions of the Democrats these past two months could ever possibly disgust someone who has voted Democrat for his entire life, just because that must be impossible I'm now getting called a liar and a plant. Violent rioting and constant complaining and calling every single detractor a "nazi" and screaming and throwing tantrums are fine. Anyone who doesn't think so, even if they voted the way you wanted is either a nazi, liar, or a plant.  Unbelievable. Fuck off. >  EDIT - I'm glad to see this was posted all over our front page. 
the local fox feed just showed a woman in a MAGA hat getting interviewed, she said she's just there to show support for her side and she was giving props to the people who were protesting peacefully and then someone sprayed her in the face with pepper spray
Left wing fascism. Call it for what it is. Use their own words against them. 
This was just a few months ago @ UC Berkeley where protestors were demanding the school turn over property for use as "safe spaces" and white people were being blocked and not allowed to travel across a bridge  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R6dzZdceT4
It's funny. A year ago I considered myself pretty left leaning.  Shit like this has been pushing me further and further to the right. I can't believe I was so blind to it before. 
There was literally a woman in a MAGA hat being interview by ABC7 who was praising the small minority group that wasn't violent and low and behold a progressive comes up to her, while she is being interviewed, and pepper sprays her.  Of course the cuck reporter/camera man does absolutely nothing.
"THE LEFT IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED OF FREE SPEECH AND WITH DO LITERALLY ANYTHING TO SHUT IT DOWN"  Sounds exactly like what reddit did today to /altright
Fox News has this on now
[removed]
Fat white woman holding sign that says 'trans women of color deserve respect'.  LOL.
Please burn the ENTIRE campus down ! Please !! Do it !!  You're really helping your cause !
Expecting a response from President Trump on this one. This hateful intolerance on the part of the Left is out of hand.
If he ever speaks in PITTSBURGH I offer myself to help with security.
I spotted a black/red socialist flag and covered faces.
If this was happening to a liberal there would already be 1000 lawsuits filed.  Civil rights investigation, protests, multi-million dollar settlements and on and on.
Protesting fascism by shutting down free speech with violence.  Do these people not how fucking ridiculous this is?
Textbook fascism
https://www.periscope.tv/w/1eaKbRWMpZeKX# 59 minute mark. They bash in a man's head with a shovel: he's the one lying on the ground. Fuck the left. This is what calling everyone nazis does. This man will most likely die because the left thought they were fighting fascism while actually being fascists.

Wow, I never thought I'd live to see the day where a Jewish Gay man would make people at Berkeley set their own campus on fire and, in the name of tolerance, destroy a building named after MLK! Well done, regressives, well done.   \*golf clap*
Where the fuck are the police and why aren't they doing anything about these violent af criminals?

He's talking to Tucker right now and said an anon donor payed the security fees. I bet anon is Peter Thiel. 
We should say Milo is hiding in Nancy Pelosi's local office on twitter.
>the Left is absolutely terrified of free speech and will do literally anything to shut it down  r/altright says hello
Milo made his point without the speech. These youngsters thinking they are so cool for being in the "Resistance" force. Their mind is so poisoned 
They trashed the MLK Jr building
There was one protestor next to whatever the hell they were burning with a "no fascism" sign.    So much cognitive dissonance it's insane.
[deleted]
So this means the left is now anti gay male? 
The best part of this is violent riots are proven to turn people toward conservative viewpoints.
I'm buying a gun tomorrow.  If someone swings a flag pole at my girlfriend's head I'm going to shoot them dead.
[deleted]
Guys they just cucked themselves!  The building Milo was supposed to speak in was the Martin Luther King Jr. building!  On the first day of Black History Month, they just destroyed a building dedicated to one of the most prominent black civil rights activists, in a protest of *FREE SPEECH*.  The cognitive dissonance is through the roof!  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/milo-yiannopoulos-uc-berkeley-event-canceled-after-violent-protests/
who is sending their kid there after seeing this ? oh wait. liberals are aren't they ...
**These are not "protestors" - these are mercenary thugs for a power-hungry Global Oligarchy hellbent on punishing anyone who dares oppose them.**  **How DARE you claim any moral high ground, you repugnant elitist pigs, filth not fit to wipe Milo's glorious gay %ss.  Your vicious treatment of a Gay Jew is fixing to get this Christian Woman going FULL METAL BAPTIST on your racist brownshirt army.**
reminder: the mayor of this shithole city, told police to stand down.  you heard me correctly, yes.  allegedly there was someone who was beat with metal pipes and may be dead.  if true, their death is on the mayors head.  how in the FUCK can you tell police to stand down in the face of rioters?  blows my fucking mind.  this is an absolute disgrace.
"Anti-gay fascists shut down free speech on Berkeley campus."  For sure headline in tomorrows papers. 
#LITERALLY FASCISM
Let's ship these idiots out and replace them with some freedom loving refugees who don't mind waiting a little longer to get into this beautiful country.
The first amendment only grants the right right of the people to assemble peaceably.        Further, these jackasses are preventing other people's right to free speech (in addition to vandalism, violence and other crimes).       At what point do the gloves come off?            Another approach might be for the Federal govt to shut down these schools completely for 30 days (for safety purposes) if they can't control the crowds (believe me, the schools will find a way) and cut off all federal funding to the school.  That would include any federally backed student loans.         These losers aren't fighting for a cause, they are just destroying things because no one is holding them accountable.   They didn't go as far, but behaved similarly back in the 90's when Berkeley had its "Firestorm".  (They didn't start the fire, but used it as an excuse).       Thugs need jail, not hugs.  
So wait, who are the fascists again?
r/Anarchism is so proud of itself right now.  What a bunch of fuckin' losers.   Edit:I see they've since hidden/deleted the thread cheering on the violence. Can't stand by their own shitty ideology. 
He's doing a lot of work for this movement. Every time this happens, more and more people understand the reality of the leftist infestation.
I know its wrong. But I kinda laughed at the irony or looting a friggin starbucks.
“The whole reason we’re here is for free speech,” Gow said. “Milo’s hate speech is not allowed here. When it’s hate speech, our free speech is to shut him down.”  Can't argue with that. And remember, they're not fascists. You can tell because they spraypainted antifa on the ATM they robbed and set fire to.
Between this shit and the push by the elite to make this a sanctuary state, I need to get the fuck out of here.
The left fascists are against free speech because they're run out of arguments. They are trapped in an ideological Logic Loop, on the one hand believing what CNN and other corporate media is telling them but on the other hand also hating capitalism and very powerful people. This is a wonderful contradiction and since these people are too stupid to escape from this... so they just get violent in their frustration. And that's the reason the one and only reason why they hate Trump, for he is the one that could strike down the one percent elite, but they are absolutely indoctrinated to see Trump the racist, misogynist and xenophobic by the mainstream Media owned by exactly these corporations they are hating so much. They are absolutely not knowing who they can blame. So they are destroying public facilities and Starbucks stores and in the future maybe even human lifes.     
(52% upvoted)  The canceling of that event is literally shutting down free speech  Whoever downvotes this post is subhuman trash
This just continues to get better. The red-pilling never stops. My fingers are crossed that this bullshit makes people aware of how poor their party's moral standards really are.   Side note. Starting to believe this is all they have left and they're desperately clinging/violently erupting at any chance they get because they realize if Trump does succeed their party is fucking toast.  
I swear most of the people there were just students like myself watching because it was interesting. Most of us were really pissed to see our campus structures getting smashed and fires being set off on our main plaza.   That building was the MLK Student Union. It's where I go to study Tuesdays and Thursdays. Even worse, the section that got smashed in was an Amazon delivery center that gives amazing service and prompt deliveries to all college students. Just because Milo had his event there doesn't give anyone the right to smash apart my campus.
Good ole BerkREEEEEEEE
Fascism. Plain and simple.
Liberal progs:  #YOU'RE A FASCIST! SET FIRE TO EVERYTHING AND STORM THE HALL SO HE CAN'T SPEAK!  Oh the fucking irony.
Fuck SJWs. Fuck liberals. It is a mental illness and they are terrorists. 
I graduated from Cal in 2015, and spent a year afterwards working. I met many great people there, and I love many things about that place.  Except for when some shit like happened, holy fuck. Right now people I know from there are talking to me about how crazy it is there right now. University windows are smashed, some trees were on fire, fuck. This is not how this should be. It's the reason why I went there liberal and came back as a proud centipede.
Lol at the guys holding the USSR flag.  Its so odd, if anything they wanted americans to die.  I don't understand how these fucking idiots think Stalin, Che Guevara, Fidel, Lenin and others wanted a better society. It's 2017 go read a fucking book, morons.
My buddy took a brick to the head and was carried off my a helpful marine.  I'm so pissed at this crap 
The rioters are now vandalizing random businesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8uW3Mpzevg OMG THEY ARE LOOTING STARBUCKS...HIRE THEM NOW YOU IDIOTS
My cuck "friend" is on Facebook posting that hate speech and discrimination doesn't fall under freedom of speech and that milo is a self hating gay who is harmful to the gay community, women and muslims. I just can't! I told him he's an idiot and argued with him for a few posts but there's no getting through to him he moved to New York and turned into a fully brainwashed cuck we were friends for 10+ years but he's so dumb now I don't think I could ever hang out with him again.
We joke about it, but fuck, this could really be the death of the left. It's just all going so well.
Serious question and not a call for any type of action. When does law enforcement start actually enforcing some law ?  
Video compilation of these protesters assaulting Trump supporters and wreaking havoc: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3fT6pnhjJA 
I hate this guy BUT he has every right to speak. Shame on the idiots that riot. 
Milo is intelligent, brave, and the more hatred they spew at him the stronger he gets. 
I was 1 block away when it started.  I managed to escape through the traffic going up Channing to Piedmont to 13.   If you're near campus always head to the hills, up to Grizzly Peak / Tilden Park to be safest.  You can get WAY up 13 and at the very least, camp out somewhere and be very safe in comparison to an urban warzone.    
Oh, you mean the same Berkeley where this video was shot? https://youtu.be/vZCVHB68cuY  Funny. Cause I don't see Milo in that video being ignorant and RACIST. 
It's weird watching this thread get an average of 11 downvotes per second. I wish I had that kind of money...
Don't fall for it everyone.   They want a Trump supporter to react, then that will be the story forever.  The only reaction should be to highlight this, talk about it, get it exposure, but never, ever, no matter what, react violently, that is exactly what they want, do not give it to them.
As a California resident, I fucking hate Berkeley so fucking much. So sick of this shit
WE ARE BEING BRIGADED! Post things that liberals hate !
They do indeed hate social equality.
- Free speech  - Tolerance  - Diversity of opinion  - Winning
This image has actually pissed off a lot of liberals on my facebook and I have no fucking clue why. ISN'T THIS WHAT THE LEFT WAS FIGHTING FOR?! Oh, look, republicans are finally on board with fighting for LGBTQ rights, wasn't that the goal? But no, clearly Trump is a secret homophobe. That must be it.  Give me a fucking break.
**REMINDER**  Trump was attacked for [holding the flag upside down](http://www.coloradoindependent.com/162103/guest-post-trump-lgbt-flag),   >Upside down flags have been used traditionally to communicate danger or distress. And Trump’s stunt, clearly choreographed by his campaign as a plea for support to LGBT people, was actually another reminder of the threat his candidacy represents to LGBT equality.  but if he held it right side up the text would be upside down and he would have been attacked for that.  The fake news sites do not care what you say or do. They are already working on negative stories from multiple angles to pull at the drop of a hat.

They want everyone who disagrees with them to tolerate their verbal abuse, stigmatizing labels, and intolerance.  They hate anything and anyone who disagrees with them. Most of all, they hate the good.

To show how obtuse the liberal mentality is, I've been told many times that this image is photoshoped. I've shown the video footage and they tell me to drop dead. The depth of liberal delusion is substantial. To drag a liberal out of their delusion is a dangerous thing. 
Trump forgot the Q! That's why they are pissed! It all makes sense now! 
They really do hate seeing us gay Trump supporters. As well as us minority Trump supporters. Because they desperately want inequality to continue, even if it's just in our imaginations. That way they can convince us all republicans are our enemies and that we should vote for their side always.

I actually saw people start a Facebook argument over "this is so staged, the rainbow is upside down."  Are you fucking kidding me? We're gatekeeping sexuality now? You can't really be gay if you don't know which side of the rainbow should be up? Or is it one of those things like a cross, where the meaning gets inverted too?  Alt-left logic, folks. Shit like that is why I'm here.

the truth
I actually don't like this. I don't want to accept people because they are gay or not. I'll accept people because they are nice/respectful/hard-working, etc. I don't care if you are gay or not unless I want to be in a romantic relationship with you.   But whatever.
I was happy when I watched the video of him saying he was proud that him and his fellow republicans were cheered for announcing their support of the LGBT community. A fellow countryman should always feel included, and that is what Trump provides.

But apparently they presume we're racist but in turn show their true colors by thinking skin color hurts anybody. They are degrading themselves by trying to discredit us. It's very sad.
As a lover of 1960's Liberal movement (screw these SJW liberals) - * Facts that destroy there talking points. * Being told to look at the bigger picture * Reminding them there feelings are NOT a protected right. * Pointing out that everyone is different * We should not cower to the lowest common denominator: but instead should lift them up  * Objective anything.  Ask apposed to subjective. * Camera's.  As a photo person my self I HATE when my picture is taken, however I know the law that the person taking my picture in public is well with in there right to do so.
Why must we divide ourselfs? We are one with many ideas that cause us to add unnecessary friction.

Hmm.. I'm unsure what his actual stance is. He picks staffers who are staunchly Anti-LGBT (supporting Conversion therapy) which says something about him (you tend to pick people who share your views).   He's also been quoted saying some pretty anti-LGBT statements:   "I'm not in favor of gay marriage," he said on Fox News.  He made the same comment on NBC's "Meet the Press," saying, "I live in New York. New York is a place with lots of gays and I think it’s great, but I’m not in favor of gay marriage."  "I think I’m evolving, and I think I’m a very fair person, but I have been for traditional marriage. I am for traditional marriage, I am for a marriage between a man and a woman," he said on CNN.   And, he doesn’t think gay couples even deserve civil benefits.   "No and no,” he said in 2011, referring to gay marriage and civil benefits.  So I'm unsure that one pic of him holding up the Pride flag is enough to convince me that he's pro LGBT rights, but it's a tiny step in the right direction. Actions will speak louder than words here.

HOLY FUCK THIS WAS HUGE STEP FOR US
Ben Swann is pretty based. He also factchecked Donna Brazile stealing the CNN Townhall question. Libs continue to deny that she did it. Give him credit for bursting their lies.
My favorite thing about this coming back into the spotlight is we can use their own argument against the. You know the one, **"even if there is the slightest amount of evidence that Russia hacked the election, don't you think we should look into it? Or do you support Russia's involvement in the election?"** Now we can say ***"Even if there is the smallest shred of evidence that children are being kidnapped molested or raped shouldn't we investigate? Or do you support the molestation rape and murdering of children?"***  
[Johnny Gosch the original milk carton boy,](www.ranprieur.com/readings/gosch.html) his mother hired two powerful PIs since the police and FBI didn't want to look into the case.

What are the archived instagrams that they were unable to show here?  Are they too disturbing/dangerous for normal folks to see? I'm nervous as hell when investigating this stuff.  Spez: Everyone, thank you for the links and responses. CNN and others trying to normalize this shit is beyond infuriating. Imagine if this was you as a kid or worse... one of your own.  There is no normalizing this. 
Do my eyes and ears deceive me!? An actual non-biased objectively neutral presentation of the facts of the case!? What a pleasant surprise!

How great that CBS had the guts to air this.   Let's turn up the light on this.  
#HIS NAME WAS BEN SWANN
FINALLY. A non-biased reporter who simply presents the FACTS. He doesn't even mention the word "Trump" once; just the cold, hard facts, and even states repeatedly that there is "no proof." Which is fine, because that is fact.  Compare to how the MSM reports on things that haven't been proven yet (see "muh Russia"), not one of them will even say the words "it's not been proven yet".  I'm not 100% sure I myself believe pizzagate, and even it it was real the perps have had plenty of time to cover it up; but hell, it's about damn time someone at least reported on it. We really need more local news to step up their investigative reports on national news, instead of just leaving it up to the big mainstream corporations. 
The fact that investigate a potential pedophile ring where children are being abused has become a partisan issue is absolutely disgusting.   I'm not saying it exists or is real... but at least investigate it. Look into it. That's what law enforcement is supposed to do when something is suspicious.   And if the left is so hard nosed that there is nothing that happened, they should be calling for an investigation too in order to provide proof to support their opinion on it 
Ben obviously reads The_donald . Ty pedes for your research and dedicstion towards exposing the truth.
who the fuck downvotes this?? i understand your hate towards the donald subreddit, but the truth is, child rings exist whether you like it or not. if you downvote this you are a fucking idiot
As a Catholic I was glad that the priest molesting scandal was exposed, I was not glad it happened, but I was glad it got exposed so it could be corrected. As a Democrat, I am glad that pizzagate is being exposed, so it can be corrected and we can learn from our mistakes. Thanks /r/The_Donald for holding the elites accountable.

This is how I've always viewed this Pizzagate thing. There is so much circumstantial evidence - nothing solid and damning, but piles of 'coincidences' that should be more than enough to warrant some kind of investigation, but nobody has touched it. Why not put the peoples' minds at ease one way or another by looking into it?

All we know is that those 33,000 emails had information so egregious she deliberately ignored a subpoena from the FBI to hand them over  EDIT: ANYBODY WHO DOWNVOTES ANYTHING REGARDING PIZZAGATE, ANYBODY WHO SAYS WE SHOULD NOT INVESTIGATE PIZZA GATE, ANYBODY WHO SAYS WE SHOULD NOT TALK ABOUT PIZZA GATE IS A PEDO ENABLER.

Stuff like this always gets covered up. As we're seeing, the highest level of U.S elites are possibly (more than probably) fucking kids.  Canada's elite. Fucking kids. UK's elite. Fucking kids. Saudi Arabia's elite fuck kids but they tell everyone and aren't ashamed so.......  If you wanna see the WORST case of the elite fucking kids though, look at Scotland. The information and proof is out there. Pretty much every Scottish politician is fucking a kid. The police chiefs, the sheriffs, the judges, the whole establishment. It's why I want them to go independent, the Scottish elite are the worlds most organised, systemic kid fuckers. (This is not an attack on Scots. As we now know the elites do NOT reflect the people).  Google Holly Greig, just for a start. And then tell me how many hours you spent diving in to the abyss that is the grand Scottish elite paedophile ring.  Also, this ties in with gun control. The guy that shot the school up that led the way to gun bans was a Scottish scout leader. He knew all the local police and politicians. And he fucked kids with them all.  The holes in the Dunblane story are Sandy Hook-esque.
Yea I thought that this was insane rambling conspiracy theorist talk but watching this and reading that big ass link up in the thread with all the "evidence" in still not convinced there is an actual child sex ring going on but Jesus Christ the number of coincidences is a bit more than just eyebrow raising. Especially the #Chickenlover picture or whatever. What the fuck else could that be referring to? 
Tie this into the countless reports globally of pedophilia rings uncovered with ties to politicians in other countries and the uber rich, you see that there is and has been for a long time, a web of this evil shit going on for literally hundreds of years.  Even here we've known something was up back with the Clintons hobknobbing around with Jeffery Epstein and his associates. When it all comes out, there will be far more people that fall from graces than we all ever thought would.
This just got pulled from /r/all   FUCK REDDIT CUCKS!

Trying to examine the evidence instead of blind denials and namecalling? It's almost like there are still media figures with intellectual honesty.  I'm still not convinced on Pizzagate, but it is obvious to me that there is a disturbing amount of circumstantial evidence for it that the NYT and others didn't even bother to report because it would reflect badly on the wrong people.

I feel like this creep needs his own kreugeresque tune.   One, Two, podestas coming for you. Three, four, the emails show more. Five, six,  check the pics. Seven, eight, pizzagate. Nine, ten, never sleep again.  
He didn't even mention the strange paintings from inside the restaurant, the missing kids from Haiti, or the Podesta brothers crime sketch. Still an awesome video! 
Kids pay attention, this is what journalism looks like. Every night you'd get different channels trying to outdo eachother for the better scoop or trying to be the first to uncover the truth.
I don't understand why this is only 59% up voted? Does /r/all not want justice brought to pedophiles?

This is some disturbing stuff...
That was fantastic, and chilling.  Especially the part about the music videos where it all starts to tie together.  I thought the Pizza gate thing might very well be true when it first came out, then was thrown off by Megyn Kelly's "report" of the Comet Ping Pong's denial of anything going on (not proof, though -- she just reported his statements).  This brings it back to center stage.    Also -- Ben Swann reported that the "dossier" really was fake news, and that the British "intel" officer may have gotten the shower details from 4chan (it's the video posted before the above video on youtube, I think). 
#Just wow.  Amazing. A reporter doing his job... I've not seen that in years. This guy needs to continue!
Everybody please upvote this. We can't let this die. We can't sit idly by and allow evil to consume the world. 
Abortion Industry Busted for Pedophile Protection Racket - https://www.childpredators.com  "For several years, Life Dynamics has been investigating America’s epidemic of teen pregnancy. What we have found is that this is not the result of children having sex with children. It is being driven by adult males sexually exploiting young girls. We have also documented that two national organizations are operating an illegal pedophile protection racket that protects these men.   In February and March of 2002, we conducted an undercover phone survey of Planned Parenthood and National Abortion Federation facilities. Our goal was to document their level of compliance with state mandatory reporting statutes. This was not a random survey but a universal one. We identified 906 facilities in the U.S. as being associated with one or both of these organizations and we attempted to contact each one. Some were no longer in operation and others used one appointment line to service multiple facilities. In the end we were able to survey representatives of 813 of the original 906, including facilities in every state except Mississippi. Our caller portrayed a 13-year-old girl who was pregnant by a 22-year-old man and wanting an abortion in order to conceal this illegal sexual activity from her parents and the authorities. This is a mandatory reporting situation in every jurisdiction, yet over 90 percent of the counselors from these two groups agreed to ignore the law.   This site contains tape recordings and printed transcripts of all 813 calls."
FINALLY! I've been trying to tell people all along that pizzagate is real and that it's been covered up and not investigated at all. Thank God there are still a few reputable journalists left. Remember that there are real children's lives at stake here. 
What about the link between the Podesta brothers and Madeleine Mccann?  The pics?  Was there any truth to that or hoax?

Nazis
So true it's sad.
Could you imagine if they knew then what they were fighting for would become today?  
Because they're Commies, and since the end of WWII Commies everwhere always call everyone against them Nazis/Facists.
Perfect.

Yep. My great grandmother immigrated to the United States (LEGALLY) to escape the Nazi bullshit. I especially take offense at being called a Nazi for believing EXACTLY what my great grandmother believed in. The only literal Nazism I see going on are from the liberals, telling people they cant celebrate their candidate winning without property damage or physical violence, you can't be proud of your President without having your head caved in or having your house burned down...etc..etc..etc.. Remember assholes whether they want to admit it or not (sorry berners) but Nazism started out of the Socialist movement. Don't bother to respond with "it wasn't true socialism" bullshit. Socialism was the vehicle for that cancer. Now let's celebrate this win, this amazing victory and ignore the actual Nazis who are still salting the streets with their crocodile tears.
I'm worried this culture leads to immigrants or children of immigrants to fight for their "home" country rather than ours or their current one.    My great grandparents were German born and immigrated here, not long after, my grandfather was born. He immediately signed up when the war came around. He was ready to fight the Germans.    Today we see children who are born here waving Mexican flags or joining ISIS.. 
OMG is the entire country finally being red pilled.... Leftists have turned good into evil and their globalists policies have destroyed the crown jewel of the planet (USA), and created global warming. We are waking up, I hope. 
America is still the shining city upon a hill whose beacon light guides freedom-loving people everywhere. We can still save Western civilization by saving America and preserve hope for mankind.

##Thats a textbook weaponized shitpost.  
My family lineage has soldiers that have fought in every war from The Revolutionary War through WWII.   I believe with all my heart and soul that this country, under President Trump, will now finally, after so many years of turmoil, give honor to their legacies.  God Bless America.  🇺🇸
So succinct, I've been trying to find a way to say this for ages.  Any form of traditionalism is "nazism" to these self destructive selfhating leftist losers.
Fuck u/spez
Oh guys. The really cool and trendy communists and antifa are brigading us.   Hey lefties. Get bent. Or get crushed. Your choice.
I like it. I've been saying that my grandfather fought Nazis. My father fought communists. Now we are being called Nazis by communists.   
[credit to the person who said it first](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CWYnAQ8UEAICkqi.jpg)
And the republican party fought the democratic part to end slavery only to be called racists for believing what the republican party believed.
Well Im sure our grandparents did nazi this coming.
This.
let me just say that the snowflakes on the header bar are AMAZING. and yes, this is true
Imagine how long some of these snowflakes would last in the conditions the Battle of the Bulge was fought in.
The far left has been exposed as the most intolerant, bigoted group in the USA. Hopefully moderates will leave the party and stay with TRump going forward.
Is it ironic that Nazi's name is "The National Socialist German Workers' Party"? Every socialism country did same things: Waging political power to rob one group while serving the other; Name calling their opponents as "the enemy of the state"; The bigger the government the stronger the country; And each socialism party wants to have their own loyal military force, China's People Liberation Army or Nazi's waffen-SS as the best examples  Nowadays people calling others Nazis simply because they haven't lived in a real Nazi society yet
My grandfather fought in WW2 and came back with a GI loan for college. With the degree he earned, he eventually ran a successful insurance business that allowed my father and our family to have a high standard of living.   I was told to "check my white privilege" because, at the time GI college loan were not given to people of color.(not sure if true or not) Therefore, my families wealth was somehow built on racism. 
Anyone who calls Donald Trump or his supporters Nazis, need check  their Christian, American privileges. Donald Trump said a few un PC things. The Nazi's killed about 13 Million People and dehumanized and demoralized millions more. If you think Trumpeters are Nazis, you don't know what the F a Nazi is!

WWII is a very abstract thing to college kids today.  It was their great grand parent's war.  They have no ties to it. All they know is Hitler bad, USA bad for the bomb.  They can't relate to the struggle and sacrifice the every day citizen, on both sides, performed to support the war effort.  Everything they have now is a result of the greatest generation, and they squander it.
fact-the 60s generation will go down as the worst generation which followed the greatest generation. 
It baffles me how these people think, truly and deeply disturbing that the want to go back to censorship, segregation and witch hunts.
Man, so well put. Sad!
Darryl Cooper is the original source of this quote, and he is hella based. Check out his "Decline of the West" and "Martyr Made" podcasts
*Our grandparents fought Nazis so we could be called Nazis for believing what our grandparents believed by people who in some parts believe the same shit Nazis believed in.
We are LITERALLY being called Nazis because we reject National Socialism. 
When I see very insightful comments in here with negative points I know our intolerant opponents are mindless shills. I went to an incredibly liberal university too but I didn't come out of there with brain AIDS. I can't believe how weak minded our society has become. 
We should've been fighting the communist Soviet Union, even General Patton said he thought we were fighting against the wrong enemy. He died shortly after. 
Russian American here. 100% true. Please don't lecture me about how evil Nazism is when my ancestors died by the tens of millions fighting against it and I taught all my life about how evil it is. SMH.   Then the liberals go "let's try socialism, it'll work this time, what do you know about it?" BRUH

The quote is pretty badass. The avatar photo is funny though. Like, lemme make sure it's juuuuuuuust cool enough, and take photo 
There was a surprising amount of academic similarity between Nazi Germany and 1930's/40's America. At the same time that Hitler was killing gays, infirm, delinquents, Jews, and gypsies the state of California was chemically castrating blacks, for example. Our culture has changed, but in many ways it has changed to the detriment of whites as a race and the West as a culture itself. What they did wasn't *fair* to victims, but what's *fair* to victims isn't always what's best for the majority either. Was it *fair* to intern Japanese families during WW2? No. Was it beneficial to the US, considering the Japanese will and style of fighting? It appeared to be at the time.  Eventually we will have to strike a line between what allows us as a culture to thrive and what is *fair* to everyone else.
I can't wait until Hitler and the Nazi's stop being referenced so much, it makes me wish I was Armenian sometimes, nobody knows or references that genocide nearly as much. Whether its stormfront or conspiracy theorists or the ADLl, it seems everyone wants to talk about Hitler all the time. Ugh.

Don't worry all my family was sent to the pacific front to fight the japs. 
If our grandparents knew what would come of America and Europe, they would have refused to fight Nazi Germany. 
#**QFT**
I agree. 
Your grandpa probably fought the nazis only to be called one by an actual overly privileged idiot. It's an awesome society the left has crafted everybody!
#Spicy
He just copied John Rivers' pinned tweet. But that's a little too far right for The_Donald.
The funny part is liberalism has shifted so much to the left that we are still probably less conservative than our grand parents and still called fascists. 
It's sad our grandparents fought against national socialism to end up with the globalist racist society we live in now.
Watch,  Appocalypse: The Second World War. Amazing documentary about the brutality and shear BIG balls men and women had back then. Such people! 
My grandfather was secondgeneration Polish, he was part of a tank crew during WWII and was in Berlin during it's fall.  I like to think he had the attitude of, "You want to drive tanks into MY motherland?  Let's see how YOU like it, motherfuckers!"  It sucks he passed away when I was six, I'd love to learn more about his time in the Army during the was.  I'm proud to be his descendant. 
Dat moment when your from an immigrant family and your grandfather fought along side the Facists...

#simply awesomeness  well said pede!
It is incredibly disturbing how easily those who didn't vote for Trump see eveyone who did as some vile sub-human. I understand for some, this sub is an annoyance, but my god - some of the things I'm seeing these hateful people say to their fellow Americans - their own countrymen, decent, regular people, are just absolutely BRUTAL.  I wonder if some of you hear yourselves? For all the the screeching about TOLERANCE AND INCLUSION that the left does, what I have seen lobbed at us RELENTLESSLY is some of the most INTOLERANT, HATEFUL shit I have EVER witnessed. Those of you who hate us over a difference of opinion have chosen - literally MADE THE CHOICE TO IGNORE THE FACTS - to believe the lies, the insults, the false accusations about a HUGE swath of your country. No matter how many times we prove the lies to be lies, no matter how many times it is proven over and over again that this entire campaign of hate AGAINST US was a purposefully false, abhorrent narrative by Hillary, the DNC and the entire fucking media, some of you REFUSE to even CONSIDER that we might just NOT be the fucking super-villains you're been brainwashed to believe we are.  You don't know me. You don't know ANY of us personally. You have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to base your hate of us on than the GARBAGE you've been SPOON FED for almost 2 years. We're your friends, your family, your neighbors; we're your doctors, teachers, mechanics; we bring you your packages, we stock your grocery stores; we take care of your kids, we help you out when you get a flat tire at the store in the pouring rain. WE ARE YOU, WE ARE AMERICANS IN IT TOGETHER. So, why the hate? Why the INSISTENCE on clinging to this truly disgusting and failed ideology that tells you we're pieces of shit deserving of your hate, your slander, your VIOLENCE? I just don't get it. If you can hate a group of people you've never met, never known, know NOTHING about because that's what your political candidate and the media TOLD YOU to do, perhaps YOU are the truly hateful BIGOTS.

And our Grandfathers fought Communists so the Democrat party could be endorsed by communists and praise communist leaders of the world...
My grandparents fought Nazis from the other front, the red one. But I do support Trump not because he would befriend Putin (Putin is shit IMO), but because I do know what communism looks like. If the cancer of socialism infects US our planet is doomed. 
i did nazi that coming
Came here to say amen

Omg. This hits the nail on the head perfectly.
Yes, times change. Culture changes. Social Norms change. If you thought exactly like your grandparents did in 1940, you'd be out of touch.

Muslim bakeries in Michigan refuse to make cake for gay wedding. WHERE'S THE FRONT PAGE HEADLINES? #AmericaFirst

Some based gay couple looking to marry should go to muslim bakery, ask for wedding cake and throw a lawsuit if they don't.
kek Dearborn should just be renamed *New Arabia*.  So glad I'm on the West side of the state.
**OMG!!!! They have commited the ultimate homophobic hate crime.**

Literally this  http://imgur.com/ANao3tx  
When Christian bakeries are forced into baking gay wedding cakes it reminds me of what Ben Shapiro says. "The left says if you don't care, you will be made to care at gunpoint"
The left are just happy these muslims are actually working because the majority don't, they need people like them to use as anecdotal evidence of muslims actually contributing to America (net, they don't)

They hate Russia because of "human rights violations" and mistreating homos, but they have no problem with muslims doing it

I don't see a single mention here of the guy being Steven Crowder. He's one of the good guys. He's also responsible for this masterpiece https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUDtoDAGVE8&ab_channel=StevenCrowder 
The left and globalists really thought they were going to dominate this whole social media thing, didn't they? Awww, that's adorable. 😂
This was in 2015. And it was covered.   It wasn't front-page headline worthy because it was a fairly misleading video. The guy was in places that don't even make wedding cakes for Pete's sake.  I'm absolutely sure there are Muslim bakeries out there that would most likely refuse to do this, but it isn't the ones on this video, and it's a pretty clear attempt to spark outrage where non actually exists.  We're better than this, c'mon guys. Let's save our outrage for things that deserve it.  
You need to study the oppression ladder my friend.    - Muslims.  - Gay women  - women  - transgender  - black women  - gay men.  - minorities  - ?  - ?  - white men / conservatives.

Unfuckingbelievable. This would be all over the NYT and CNN if it were Christians. I'm atheist, but I'm done with this double standard. The mainstream media really is rigged against Republicans. They really do hate us.
They're not despicable, racist, homophobic, xenophobic Christians, so it's OK.  ...or, they're oppressed "minorities", so they can do whatever the f*ck they want and no one should be able to question them on it.  /s
Liberals don't give a shit because they think all Muslims are oppressed brown people.
I'm a Bernie supporter but I totally agree with you guys on this one. There is often way too much of a tendency for those on the left to over-romanticize "those poor war-torn country fleeing Muslims" not realizing that many of them are just opportunists seeking to jump on this golden opportunity to emigrate to the world's greatest/freest/most prosperous countries, the West/NATO countries. And these liberals often overlook the many atrocious features (like death for petty noncrimes like apostasy, being gay, being a non-believing infidel; basically much of the left would be targeted for death of they had their way) of most instantiations of the Islamic religion (maybe excepting the uniquely non-universalizing Ibadi sect of Islam followed by 3/4 of the population of Oman, which explains why we never hear much about violence in/from Oman, unlike its horribly religious and dangerous neighbors Yemen and Saudi Arabia).  It's tough because on the one hand you don't want to discriminate against the religious beliefs of your own citizens -- which is why we must be very careful about the number of Muslims we allow into our country as refugees. Because once they're here, they're not leaving, and they're only going to grow in number. Though I'm a liberal, I try hard to be an independent thinker and not follow the pseudo-moral outrage of cunts like Ben Affleck (check out his head butting on Bill Maher's show with Sam Harris, a man streets ahead of him intellectually), I just think we would fools to allow massive Muslim emigration from the Middle East/Somalia/east/North Africa.
got to be a gay bakery out there that refuses to make a straight cake to just melt down all this nonsense once and for all.  some people are just assholes regardless of how they self identify.
This is truly the best timeline.
My God, these libs really do hate Christians.  
This seems more high energy then usual:  >  1,015,900 votes   More algorithm shenanigans? 
I'm not big on Trump, but I'll be damned if this doesn't seem pretty hypocritical.   Fair is fair. Outrage over both occasions seems reasonable. 
He is insulting and persecuting the bakery. Behead him!!!
Dearborn. Good god. That place is a fifth column for Islam.
It would be hilarious if 500 Dearborn pedes had time to go there a couple days in a row and each one asking for gay wedding cakes.  
Nobody claims injustice because the RIGHT people are committing the injustices.
HAHA as if these muslims will be forced to do something against their religion of peace.
ITT: People not understanding this is a joke and that the idea is that muslims are held to a different standard not that business should or should not bake cakes for everyone who asks.
The enemy is cowardly and loves to assault peaceful people. The threat of violence keeps the left more in line than people think. They really want a fight where their opponents don't fight back.  
I had to open this post from the donald. If I tried opening it from my front page my official reddit app crashed
The left uses whatever group is expedient in its quest for cultural Marxism's victory: the complete and utter destruction of the American nation-state, its culture and the American way of life.  And Islam is one of the perfect vectors for them to do so or so they think.
The white house should pointedly screen for LGBT acceptance among refugee/immigrant applicants.  Ask them: "Will you live peaceably among homosexuals and transgendered as your coworkers and classmates"? and chop the ones who show any homophobia.  This policy will disqualify the majority of applicants AND gain some based LGBT voters.  
yeah /r/atheism are a bunch of faggots that will turn a blind eye to this shit. Why do they even call it atheism it should just be /r/atleastnotchristians
But, but... Muslims are suppressed minorities, they should love gays!
It won't make the news, it never ever will. It's against the narrative and for all the injustice that this provides the world, it doesn't matter, the narrative is more important. They're muslim so they must be oppressed and treated with different standards than christians because that's what this is, religious favouritism.   The same people decrying christian attitudes to gay rights won't breath a word to muslims. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't just so damn hypocritical but stories like this are the kick I need every time I feel like maybe my right wing views are to be questioned again. Every time I think "hmm maybe the lefties have a point" and there's a dozen stories like this to send me running from that thinking. It really does seem like I would have to suspend my ability to objectivity check the news and the facts to be left wing these days. All emotion, that's all it is.

Something something liberal agenda
This may be somewhat of a humorous post...but the seriousness of this should not be undermined. By spotlighting this kind of hypocrisy is how we slowly flip ppl over to this side. Keep this up until p.c culture dies.
Sharia law rules in dearbornistan. Shit is really fucked up there
liberals heads will explode
Progressives think of Muslims as "Noble Savages" which is why they make so many excuses for them. They think Muslims are too dumb to do this stuff.  They have to be a white savior to the simple brown people. 
**and..... we have tolerant [downward arrows](http://i.imgur.com/1a3aKEA.jpg)**  
It'll be interesting to see how this unfolds. Personally, I hope the administration uses this as a way of abolishing whatever moronic laws Barry introduced. This is the perfect time to back the leftists into a corner. Make them choose between gay people and Islam.
Narrative does not aline. Please try again. 
Everyone has the right to do this shit, fuck double standards.
Lol this is good.  I agree with any businesses right to refuse service to whoever they want btw.  But this is great to expose hypocrisy 
What the fuck will liberals do now?  The narrative is dead! No way to spin this, they are either against gays or muslims.  Bahaha BTFO
Man, fuck liberalism's booty gape for Islam. No fucking reason to like Islam. 
[There were headlines about this nearly two years ago when Crowder first exposed it April'2015...](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/5/video-puts-muslim-bakeries-florists-in-gay-rights-/)
What a pity! I specifically wanted a wedding cake made by people whose entire religion is nothing but a lengthy diatribe against everything I am.

Will they get ridiculed, prosecuted & bullied like that Christian shop did?

Really though people who are getting a same sex marriage shouldn't get offended when people with religious beliefs stand up for said religious beliefs regarding marriage. Which religious people hold to be a religious institution not a civil institution.
I knew it was going to be freakin' Dearbornistan.  The last time I went there I was in grade school.  Went to the Henry Ford museum.  I wonder if people still go there for field trips and such.  From what I remember it was a nice city.  A quick google search has revealed it's a shit hole now.
How does a gay wedding cake differ from a straight wedding cake?    Is it the grooms/brides on top?    Not fucking around, don't really know.    In Canada, you can deny service based on race, believe it or not.    Retirement homes can be structured in a way that only a certain language is spoken.    Gay/Straight I can't think of any example in which you can discriminate.    Male/Female/Other - Heavy discrimination.  Women's only gyms.  Bath houses, for all intense and purposes.  Mosques.  
As a fairly liberal guy, this shit is just as bad as any other discrimination. It should not be allowed.  The sjws that tolerate this shit are a as bad as the intolerant people themselves.
I wouldn't trust a muslim bakery anyway.
I seriously agree with this post and the commenters on it almost 100%. There is a huge double standard here. But I think the double standard is less of one against "white" christians than it is a societal double standard against "Christianity".   I would definitely love to see this experiment done with say an African American homosexual, or Mexican homosexual. Because I think they would deny them all equally simply because they were homosexual (no matter the race).   My point is society has a serious bias against the Christian faith; increasing as it moves towards fundamentalism. I think it can be proven that it is a specific discrimination against the Christian faith and I think the faith is considered "western" which automatically implies "white", humans tend to be visual creatures and like to personify their hate.   There are many opinions, what is it people hate about the "west"? Is it because the west = America? Is t because America = white? Is it because white = Christian? I think the common denominator in every option is Christianity.

oh no that sucks!!!  gay here. who the fuck cares. Find a bakery that will make you a cake.  
Build the wall. Vet the refugees. America 1st.  And if we can sneak in there to remove all liberals from the USA, that would be ideal.
I just watched the Ashtom Kutcher address to Congress regarding human trafficking. I feel like it's relevant because I am consistently told what I need to be concerned about on TV (Russia, "Bowling Green" tee hee, Sweden? Bannon! to name a few) & somehow news like we are only trying to get illegals out that are fucking committing crimes, and the 7 countries that are on the "Ban!" Homosexuality is a crime and women are severely oppressed(although some of their punishment they consider a states right issue, much like bathroom use here now!). And speaking of the bathroom, I have a 6 year old daughter. The fact is she wasn't born trans, she will always unquestionably use the women's bathroom. At this moment in time, this seems like a political issue. It is not. In this equation as it stands, SOMEONE is going to be uncomfortable. That's just the way it is and I support your journey into finding your gender identity, I really do. But I can tell you that I am not in a place where I'm comfortable sending her into a bathroom where zhe has his cock out and is taking a leak. Again, no disrespect, I just dont see how it is me that unquestionably needs to be the uncomfortable one. What did we do before? Did you just use the bathroom of your choice and there was no problem because no one that wasn't transgender that suddenly felt emboldened to use the issue as an excuse to enter a womens bathroom? You just snuck into the stall, did what you had to do, washed your hands and fixed your hair and left, no? Whatever the answer is, I wouldnt know. But at 38 I just don't remember this one ever being an issue and that's why I'm not comfortable making it a civil rights issue I guess. Sorry for the rant lol. 
Typical for the allies of the hypocritical left
But guys, it's their beliefs. We should respect that, right ????
I agree with this, by the way. I think if someone wants to tank their business reputation, they should have every right to do that.

FUCK THOSE TWO-FACED LIBERAL BASTARDS. IT ONLY MAKES HEADLINES MATCHES THEIR AGENDA
TIL that Muslims are higher on the tolerance totem pole that homosexuals. 
This must be fake news because it doesn't fit my world view that was shaped by fake news.

Could you imagine if this was a white Christian bakery? Ommmmgggg the outrage 
Fucking Dearborn
Not sure on this one but the couple that targeted (and that is precisely what they did) the christian bakery WANTED to harm the people for their views on gay marriage. The couple asked several people and bakeries in order to find one that was against gay marriage, it was a targeted attack that made the victims out to be the aggressors.
Let me guess... it's in Dearborn???  What a shithole.
Love that reddit has us banned from popular. I'm sure without this sub this will reach the front of that

How racist of those gays.   Don't they have **ANY** respect for the Islamic religion???  Terrible, just terrible.
You're late to the party.  The DNC does not celebrate individual liberty. In fact, they despise our Constitutional freedoms and have allied with radical Islam to fight us.
TRUMP SUPPORTS SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. CTR AND LIBERALS BTFO!!!
[deleted]
> Trump asserted, bluntly, “it’s done.” “These cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They’ve been settled. And I’m—I’m fine with that,” he said.  LITERALLY EXACTLY WHAT I TOLD YOU PEOPLE
Wait the guy who supports gays and lesbians actually supports gays and lesbians? You don't say. 
Oh wow, it's almost like he's doing exactly what he said he would do! Holy shit, I guess reading is hard.
Globalists are always trying to use race, sexual orientation, and religion to divide people.  In Donald Trump's America, we all respect each other and respect each other's boundaries.  It's all about working together and forging a common ground to make our country great again.  Everyone from gays and evangelicals benefit when putting aside differences and working towards a common goal.  Notice how liberals always stress about differences.  
I still don't understand how this is news.  **HE DID A GODDAM SPEECH ABOUT SUPPORTING THE LGBT COMMUNITY ON THE FUCKING RNC.**
Liberals: Donald Trump doesn't support gay rights or gay marriage!  Trump: I support gay rights and gay marriage.  Liberals: We don't believe you!
I was so happy he said that in the interview.  He's going to leave LGBT rights as they are, no more, no less.
As a gay man, the closest I've come to getting legit offended is when liberals try to tell me that I'm "voting against my interests," that I'm ignorant, that I secretly must hate myself, etc etc...  What they will never grasp is that that's pretty damn close to *actual* homophobia - they are speaking down to me, condescending me, and trying to tell me that I'm just too stupid to understand things, literally for *no reason* other than my sexual orientation. It is absolutely infuriating.
Get government out of marriage. You want a business contract with somebody? Write it up yourself or get a lawyer. You want a ceremony? Pay for it yourself (and don't force somebody to perform it for you against their will). No more preferential treatment for "married" people.      edit: In response to those talking about "marriage incentive". 1) Those living in a shared domicile with children could still receive the same breaks, 2) What evidence suggests that this incentive has been effective in delivering this result? What are marriage rates and out-of-wedlock births like now compared to pre "incentive"?
I'm getting sick of hearing that he wants to cancel gay marriage. Progressives are just trying to poison the Well. 
I honestly can't wrap my head around why we feel the need to lower ourselves and prove anything to those liberal losers.
Read the entire article.  Politico needs to just shut itself down.

"Marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman" **Hillary Fucking Clinton**
#ARE WE TIRED OF WINNING FOLKS?#
I swear to God...President-Elect Trump needs to officiate a gay wedding before he takes office just so people calm down. I hear so many people saying "HE'S GOING TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO GET MARRIED!" I don't even reply.   TRUMP - OFFICIATE A GAY WEDDING, PLEASE. 
That interview was trash. More of the same biased, heavily-edited, media bull shit.
> "Donald Trump said he is “fine with” same-sex marriage but offered few specifics about his plans for the first 100 days of his administration "  ...  > "Ducking a question about his personal view on the issue, which he dismissed as “irrelevant,” Trump asserted, bluntly, “it’s done.”"  They literally can't even give him a single positive sentence, let alone an article.

jesus christ they are twisting a tit over this in /r/redacted. calling it gas lighting attempts or saying he cannot be my president and other shit.   very few commenters say its a good thing
#CUCKS BTFO
#**HILLARY WAS AND STILL SECRETLY IS AGAINST SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. THESE LIBERALS NEED TO BTFO!!!**
###"fine"  Watch the leftist media push a rhetoric through phrasing.  ###C'Mon Man 
The interviewer was a garbage can. All she wanted to talk about was drama. 
Someday, a long time from now, Liberals will grasp the idea that we actually elected a moderate republican and we know it.
But... But... hundreds of my gay friends have already been lynched since Wednesday, Matthew Shepherd style  :O    
Been posting this all over facebook, idiot liberals are still responding with "He's lying! His VP wants to electrocute gays into being straight again! How can a gay person like you support a Republican!?! The world is fucking ending right now TRUMP IS LITERALLY HITLER!! IM LITERALLY SHAKING RIGHT NOW!!1!" Ignorant fools. They'll never learn. Oh but how I do love triggering liberal fruitcakes on facebook.....never gets old!
Did you guys read the article? For the most part, it's irrationally shitting all over our President-Elect. Selective quoting and all kinds of liberal spin.  Edit: for example:  >"Trump attempted to dismiss the huge crowds of protesters in several American cities as “professional protesters” and a “small amount” of people. When Stahl asked the president-elect about reports that his supporters are “harassing Latinos [and] Muslims,” Trump did not dispute the reports."  Absolute garbage article, should not be praised in any way.
As a gay person, I'm telling you all, our community has to be a victim. We don't know how to be a non-victim. So, despite the fact that DT has never said anything to threaten the LGBTQ community, he gets labeled as a homophobe. 
**THE LEFT WON'T ACCEPT HIM REGARDLESS OF HIS POSITION ON GAY MARRIAGE, IT'S JUST AN EXCUSE THEY USE, THEY WANT TO SEE THIS COUNTRY FAIL**
The funny thing is how many liberals are trying to be like "haha, he's turning on his supporters!"  No you dumb, stupid, idiots. We KNEW this all along, we WANTED and SUPPORTED this all along. The fiction that Trump hates LGBT people is purely a liberal media invention.  Next they're going to act surprised and pretend we're disappointed that he's not going to legalize hunting black and hispanic people, because shockingly he supports human rights, as do we.
There are some churches that accept gays with open arms. Everyone deserves to be able to get married. Its such a big part of our culture that its understandable that gays would also want to be able to be married. But it should be a willing thing, not forced to do it by someone who doesnt care.
The media creates a phony narrative that Trump is anti-gay and is shocked when it isn't real.  Strangely, none of us, who actually listened to the man, are surprised at all.
For fucks sake, he was holding the rainbow flag up. It was no secret. 
Liberals WANT him to not want it, just so they can say HA!. They are toying with peoples lives for a laugh
Pretty sure he supported it before $hillary even
COGNITIVE DISSONANCE INTENSIFIES

GET THIS PRESIDENT A COAT!
His answer to this question really proves how intelligent he is. He really owned CBS shills... Not a fan of gay marriage(support more of a traditional situation), but his answer is terrific. "Its LAW..." bitch...
Liberal friends are already complaining on facebook. "He's pro ssm but anti-abortion? Guess which one of those he's going to flip on 2 minutes from now?"  Etc.    We need to crush these fucking cucks. Now.
It's going to be great when he will have appointed the first openly gay man to a cabinet position - Peter Thiel!  Can't wait to hear how the Left will make it out to be a bad thing. 
Also people are scarred about their illegal family members getting deported, just remember Obama has deported more people than any other president.
See the language in that article? Slanted, disrespectful, twisted, spun and distorted. 
This is posted on LGBT as well, and in the comments, they just refuse to accept that he isn't a homophobe. Despite all evidence to the controversy.

#**PAYING ATTENTION /R/ALL?**
Love it. As expected, he did fantastic in that interview.
<3 I knew I voted for someone who loved and accepted me and my lifestyle. Trump says I belong in America and deserve the same rights as everyone! 
They tried to use this to attack trump earlier in the primaries. NY Democrat. Of course leftist are stupid and defends Muslims the same night Orlando happen instead of the lgbt community.
And in similar breaking news, water has been confirmed to be wet.
They're dismissing this in /r/cuckedpolitics.  Some people will just refuse to accept that he can be good in any way. I think if he discovered the secret to immortality and gave it to everyone they would still say he's a piece of shit for some random reason. 
[deleted]
/r/lgbt is crying because their rights will be protected under a trump presidency. They want attention and will lie to get it
How is this even news?  He was waving a gay flag around?  It's like they created a monster and now are shocked when he isn't one.  BREAKING NEWS - "TRUMP says he doesn't see exercising nuclear bombs unless we are shot at first"  
Ef politico.  Trying to downplay everything he said. 
Another difference between him and Hillary. 
I wish all of my fellow faggots would just get it through their deformed minds that TRUMP DOES NOT CARE ABOUT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE. There are so many more important issues facing our country now.
I am glad that he said that his personal views were irrelevant. It takes a good leader to recognize that they have a duty to the people in that sense.
Ok.  I support LGB communities, and trans as long as they respect common sense policies like NCs bathroom law.  Im totally confused as to why reddit is focused on this so much.  It cannot possibly be as important as Trumps core policies on trade and immigration
this surprises no one in this sub

I like how liberals are now enraged...that Donald Trump supports gay marriage, and always has. 
This Politico article is terrible. So many twisted words.
#MEDIA BTFO
EVEN POLITICUCK ADMITS IT!
Oh thank God he's clarified it for the 9th time! Maybe shitlibs will finally listen.
Not to mention, he told any of his supporters who were causing trouble to stop it. Will Clinton do the same (I doubt it)
Why do this shills forget his speech after the orlando shooting? He made his position clear as day then. 
Downvoted for politico. Don't give those sellouts any clicks.
Our country is on the brink of destruction and the kids are worried about their right to stick their dicks in somebodies butthole.   This is not an issue to anyone that is not an idiot.  
Finally a socially liberal fiscal conservative 
But he will rightfully leave it up to the states
The most important thing in this article is that he asked his supporters to stop.  When will Obama and Hillary do the same?
Oh my God this is breaking news! Said nobody except CNN viewers.
People will choose not to believe this to fit their narrative. 
\>wahwahwah trump doesn't support gays  \>"I support same-sex marriage, believe me."  \>**THIS DOESN'T FIT THE NARRATIVE. DOWNVOTE DOWNVOTE DOWNVOTE**  You just can't make this shit up. These people cannot be pleased. It's almost as if regressives enjoy basking in their own shit and misery. 
There is a difference between supporting something and half heartedly accepting it as already settled.
we can't let those idiots control the narrative, that gives them power that they so desperately crave
Honestly I don't care about his position on this. What's more important is the economy. If that is not fixed, everything else is moot.
A liberal facebook-friend posted this basically saying "can you believe he said this in a lax manner and without praising it?! It's not okay to just say it like it's nbd when there is transphobic violence out there! Unbelievable."
the more and more i read this subreddit, the more i realize that trump is probably the most rational president in this election, and that people protesting him are doing so unjustly and violently
After watching the whole interview, I believe Politico watched a different interview. Spun more than cotton candy.
The idiot libtards will still whine about Pence.
The liberals are butthurt because Trump will put Supreme Court justices that will actually follow the constitution and give the rights over taxation and marriage definition back to the states. Hillary would've done the opposite and we'd see more Federal control over everything, not worth the price.   This is not about whether a gay man can walk down a street safely, or sit on a bus. Comparing this whole thing to the civil rights era of the 60's is very insulting for those who have actually suffered during that era.  
He's had a history of not only being okay with gays and gay marriage, but supportive of their causes. People overlook this. He is probably historically socially liberal for a president. These idiots rioting don't understand that. 
As a bisexual man who did not vote for Trump, I can maybe speak on behalf (somewhat, at least) of the lgbt community who, largely, did not and do not support him. I too was/am skeptical about his stance if only because of Pence's history with gay rights. I'm sure he had to see this coming; why wouldn't people find that terrifying? All in all, I'm really relieved to see news like this, and while I really did not like some of Donald's rhetoric, I think we are all rooting for him to create a more unified people and a stronger, more prosperous nation. Who wouldn't want that? 
 What is ~~Aleppo~~ CTR?
wait you're telling me trump doesn't want to murder gays and blacks? 
Sorry, Donald has to say it 6 more times until he disavows/endorses something /liberal 
I think it's important that he openly defied the traditional Republican narrative at the convention. He went out of his way to tell the gay community "we are with you, we support you..." and people cheered. He is changing the Republican party. He has continued repeating this throughout his campaign. 
I'm so proud of this man, he continues to give our movement legitimacy!
Gay marriage Is here to stay because of the Supreme Court Ruling a year or so ago. So this Gay marriage is a Non Issue. Let's move on.
OH DAG NABBIT THAT DERN LIAR TRUMP. US WHYTE SUPREMICISTS N STUFF THOT HE DUN NOT LIKE DA PEARL DIVERS AND SODOMITES!  Just kidding. Get your heads out of your assholes you hateful liberals.
 Hey /u/xtreme1461,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Le Pen refuses to wear a hijab in Lebanon: "You can pass on my respects to the grand mufti, but I will not cover myself up"
Wow, a woman politician actually standing up for women's rights. Feminists should take notes.
Le Pen is mightier than le sword
This needs to be the go-to position for female politicians and state persons 
More of a feminist than 90% of the women who identify as feminist. 
Lebanon isn't even a Muslim country to begin with, there's an around equal amount of Christians there, too. Nonetheless, good job for Le Pen standing up for something.
I thought Reddit was all about womens rights and feminism, yet I have seen nothing on this ~~or the womens chess Iran debacle~~ outside of The_Donald.   Had to sit through a week of pussyhats invading the Front Page, but god forbid people actually doing something to stand up to real womens inequality gets any press  Seriously, fuck this site. We really need to move on and take our high energy with us.
This is really feminism. Not holding a sign depicting a woman wearing the American flag as a head scarf while chanting about a wage gap.
This isn't what..  [*heavy breathing*]  a feminist look like!  [*don't shave armpit*]  This isn't what..  [*bite a block of low calorie cheesy butter*]  a feminist look like!
**FRANCE, ELECT THIS WOMAN!**
'member when the Iranian president went to Italy and Resigned Renzi decided to cover up some of their statues? [http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/01/26/nude-statues-covered-in-rome-for-visit-of-irans-rouhani-italians-outraged/](http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/01/26/nude-statues-covered-in-rome-for-visit-of-irans-rouhani-italians-outraged/)
Not a Trump supporter, not a fan of Le Pen, but I wish this kind of thing was non partisan. We all need to stand up to the oppressive culture of Eastern Islam
Le Pen is the hero Europe deserves right now.  A woman! A French woman,  is the only hope for Europe... Jesus,  what a bunch of weak men.  Where are all the men of Europe?!?!?   
Not a trump Supporter at all, politically im pretty left, and you probably wont find me here again, but this takes a strong conviction to stand up and say this, Props. 
I can't see why this is controversial. We don't make Muslim women take off their hijab to talk to our politicians so why does she have to put one on? It's not her faith! Good for her. about time someone stood up. 
Holy shit.    Le Pen has huge balls. Someone queue up that SouthPark balls in a wheel barrow meme and shop Le Pens face onto it 
Liberal hypocrisy, exposed.  Stefan Molyneux explained this quite beautifully: The left needs losers to survive. The people who are doing well for themselves and feel good about their place in society would never vote for the left.  They convince feminists that men are oppressive and the patriarchy is holding them down. They tell these feminists not to adhere to 'patriarchal' standards of beauty, so they gain 50 lbs, shave half their head, and become completely unlovable and unfuckable. They're miserable, spend all their time shitting on other people, and are completely dependent on the state (bachelors of gender studies LOL)  Similar strategies exist for other groups. Convince blacks that they'll never get ahead because whitey is holding them down and, voila, they'll never even try. Another miserable and extremely vocal dependent of the state.  But! You have to be very, *very* careful with the group you pick to be the oppressors! If you pick a group of people that is even remotely violent or oppressive, they might just come after you! That's why the left has decided to blame white males. And not just any white males, but old and modestly wealthy, conservative leaning white men.  The notion is almost comical. White men with good jobs and a family are going around oppressing women and minorities? Are you fucking kidding me? We don't have time for that bullshit. We work a full time job then come home to our families. Have to cook dinner, help the kids with their homework, and chores to do on the weekend. Oh, what, during my couple free hours a week I'm going to drive downtown and oppress some poor black kid? Seriously?  So yeah. Whites are a safe target. We are too busy being responsible adults to fight back.  Want to know who isn't a safe target? Muslims. There are millions of angry Muslims with absolutely nothing to live for, who would *just fucking love* to say, go on a suicide mission to murder the people who dared draw a comic about Mohammed.  Aaaand that's why feminists wear the hiijab.
Now that's a strong woman right there!

JE SUIS LE PEN!
Dear progressive trolls, stop explaining that a hijab is not required in Lebanon.  She was to visit the Mufti and thus will be touring a Mosque - and it will be mandatory there.  
#I'M WITH HER!
A true badass. We have the best feminists don't we folks? 
When Arab leaders come to France, the French cover up female statues out of respect for the visiting guests' culture. But when Western leaders visit Arabs they make no concession to our culture and force the women to wear headscarfs.   See it for the one-sided situation it is. They don't respect us or our culture. Time to call them on it. 
That's a true feminist right there.
You fucking know that if we had Hillary, she would jump at the opportunity to wear hijab.
SPICY!!!!!
Asking world leaders to behave drastically different because of some other people's culture is fucking retarded, especially when it's clearly a sign of blatant disrespect. Offended when women arents covered up? You objectively need to fix your culture.
She's a fucking racist homophone white male

True leaders lead by example, and Le Pen shows conservative women are the true defenders of women's rights.
lol "grand mufti", is this the fucking 12th century or something? 
As a woman, this makes me extremely happy!
Good for her ...wearing that shit is degrading. 
Muslim leaders don't roll up to meetings with western politicians rocking western clothing, I don't understand the need for it when reversed.  I of course understand there is such a thing as respecting another culture, especially when visiting their lands. But it's always **us** doing the "respecting".
It's about fucking time a politician nuts up
France is about to have a Trump-sized political wake up call in the form of this based 'pede.
Goddamn I love this woman.
If the French people had elected her father, France wouldn't have become as fucked up as it is now.
Woah an actual feminist and she is right wing, **REEEEEEEEEEE**
Lebanon used to be a predominantly Christian nation.  In this short video a former Lebanese Christian refugee (now a BASED US citizen) explains how it went from Christian to Muslim in a short space of time.  https://youtu.be/21orCM7KkRI
I love the (no more fucking around) attitude,  I hope she wins!!!
FINALLY
Based! Much better then the feminist Swedish government that let in all those "refugees", and when visiting Iran decided to wear a Hijab.
The grand mufti needs to learn how to show respect for others for a change.  
As a french person, #Imwithher
To give props where props is due: Michelle Obama did not wear a headscarf when the Obamas stopped by in Saudi Arabia when the dictatorial King died last year.
This is what real liberty and feminism looks like.  Very proud to see this day that a woman say NO to religious oppression!  This is what a "Rosa Parks" moment looks like /r/all

Acceptance: #OhShitIReallyAmACuck
About a week before the election I went to a lecture at rich college now seeking "sanctuary status"... a bunch of soft little democrats ready to laugh their ass off at Dinesh D'Souza and his "crazy" idea that HRC was a corrupt pile of trash.   I watched them go through all 5 of these stages right before my eyes over the course of an hour and half... it was truly a sight to behold.   Dinesh D'Souza doesn't use rhetoric or emotion to get a point across... he uses history and cold hard logic. Very persuasive. Whatever questions were asked he handled them like a true pro... no matter how slanted and pointed they were. He shot down every single whiney baby until they just had to admit he was right.   Felt good to see it with my own eyes in real time. 
I saw this posted yesterday.  Same thing but in graphics:  https://i.redd.it/xj3gp8vehszx.jpg  Maybe take that image and put the hashtags on it.  :)
I'm pretty sure that temper tantrum that power mod asshole threw over in r/self is considered bargaining too.   Jesus. Once the recounts finish and we're locked in we're going to have to sticky the suicide hotline in every thread once all the libs hit the depression phase aren't we?
Lol not a Trump (or Hillary) supporter but you've got to admit Trump's side comes up with brilliant memes.
Depression: But muh first female president...  Acceptance: WTF I LOVE TRUMP NOW!
Depression: No refunds!   Acceptance: MAGA
I'm a Hillary voter/filthy dem and I hit acceptance when Ohio went red

Lib from r/all here to speak my mind. Election night was tough, and that's okay. This backlash however has been utterly embarrassing. I'm a proud American, I love the way things work here, and I'm ready to support my future POTUS. A recount is an expensive waste of time and looks like a cry for help from our side. There needs to be more bridge building, less divisive action. It just sucks to see 
Why is this so accurate?
I am not sure we have enough therapists for the next stage. Time to buy some stock in drug companies.
#IDontWantToHaveAJob  #WhyAreMyTaxesLower
I hope the Depression stage last the next 8 years. While the rest of us is winning. 
My best guess for the last one....  Acceptance: #ThanksObama
QUESTION: granted this would never happen, but I'm just interested -- which stage of grief would cause an administrator of a website to modify the comments of those he does not agree with behind the scenes?
I skipped straight to stage 5. Sure my candidate didn't win, but I'm over it. I loved watching Donald Trump on his reality show 'The Apprentice' and although I may not agree with his views on the current political issues, I do believe he's genuinely a good man and a great businessman. I'm excited to see him take office and hope he does well as our President. I may not be a republican or a democrat for that matter, but I'm an American and as an American I believe *we the people* need to stick together as one unified country. #TrumpIsOurPresident

Yep.  Next they will not be able to do much but open their Play-Doh and cry

"IT"S NOT RIGGED DRUMPF SUPPORTERS"  "recount please"
Depression: recount shows Trump won even bigger than previously thought
IDGI. If you concede you are saying you're bowing out of the race and  giving up the white house. This recount should be void. 
Holy shit, so accurate 
And the Winner of Tonight's Internet is... drum rollssssss.  /u/saybel congratulations /u/saybel and thanks for playing. 
Bargaining was going the 'she won the popular vote' and trying to get faithless electors to just hand her the electoral college.  Now they've slipped back to anger and denial again. It's not always a straight progression through all of the dtages....

God bless the meme game of /r/the_donald
Sad but true. My fellow democrats are embarrassing me so much...it was clear Jill Stein was working on behalf of Hillary and now it's all just out there.   I wish we could just all move on and give Trump a chance. Everything he's said so far has been pretty reasonable TBH. Again, if things had gone the other way we'd be saying the same thing. Everyone needs to seriously just grow up. This is nowhere near Bush/Gore 2000 let's not kid ourselves. 
#high energy
Depression = \#InaugurationDay
Spot on, but we need to take this VERY! seriously. Soro's is involved.
I would say this is a little off. We saw them whine like babies before any of the three states were even called.
Really looking forward to the acceptance phase. 
That depression stage is going to be deep.
**SPICY SHITPOST**
I will declare Amen....when they are at acceptance..but it is spot on...Go Trump...Go...MAGA
i don't want to sound me but i think when trump gets in the white house. they will hit stage 4. 
Quite a number are already at the depression stage, the recount is only for the most gullible and foolhardy. 
#5StagesOfGrief is very real. #CruzMourning was a thing also. Denial & Anger lasted a LONG time, seemed like they wouldn't end. Then suddenly the bargaining started, they gave up quick & they reached acceptance. But it was an acceptance marked by constant whining & whinging, which continues to this day.
correct.  and the dems are taking this hard.  this is taking longer for them than it should.
Stage 4: ????  Stage 5: MAGA
r u havin a giggle there m8?
Actually it looks like they went from denial to anger and now BACK INTO DENIAL. They're a hysterical disaster. 
Depression/acceptance: SJW's purchase commune in Guyana, large quantities of kool-aid
The Donald I've come to bargain.  
Could have sworn I heard "not my president" back in 2008
You beautiful bastard
Recount of pop vote or not he still won the electoral college by a good amount.
Depression: #StillCrying #AmIAlone #FuckYou2016  Acceptance: #TrumpInauguration
The depression stage will be so much fun.
PSA: Assisted suicide is legal in Colorado now. 
The last one should say "bend the knee"
Acceptance will happen only once they leave their ~~safe space~~ college campus and enter the real world and have to get a job and pay for their own dwelling.
Upvote for /r/all
I assume "depression" comes once the recounts fail?
I love this sub.
The amount of hate aimed at this sub justifies it being here. You can't bully it away. 
I never watch snl but I'm drunk and watching at my friends. It's a rerun from oct and they seriously think trump will lose hahaha fucking assholes 
You're missing the 6th step where America is made great again. 
Depression: could either be civil war or mass exodus to canada or cuba.

It's worse than Buzzfeed.

Handsome bird. Best looking I've seen in years. Believe me. 
Is it really devolve though? This is CNN we're talking about.
Everybody let's upvote that comment! 
CNN has completely fallen apart ... It is literally a huge joke now. The video I just watched on CNN just called Fox News Anti-Media.
"Only 90s kids will remember when there was a Clinton in office."
Translation: "Haha guys, were sore losers".
I got banned from /r/facebook for posting the PJW video about fake news, apparently /r/facebook is just like Facebook now.
If you use "Haha" in your header, you're  listening to fake news.
Out of all the animals they could have picked, they picked a badass looking bird!  I can imagine all the other birds kneeling to the bird emperor.

Perhaps my associate has lied about his credentials.
Not much left budget wise after the Clinton machine ran outta Saudi dollars I guess.
What a Majestic Bird...  Not as Majestic as the God Emperor, 1/10th as Majestic.
Wew lad CNN going down in flames lol.
Watching CNN now is like watching a snake with its head cut off, and it's body just weakly and helplessly flailing around .
I feel that birds are code for something. Look what happened to Sanders. Stay vigilant, Don!
This is history in the making.  What we are witnessing here is CNN trying to adapt to its new surroundings.  This is a MSM identity crisis and its struggling to survive.  Good riddance
Oh god  we are winning so much  I cant take it anymore. I am drunk on liberal tears. Drowning even. Its even better than I could've ever imagined/  oh god I cant take it anymore. Everywhere I turn  "Jeff Sessions likes the KKK." "Flynn is cozy with Russia". "Bannon is antisemite." "His kids are helping him." "Trump is still making money."  And Trumps tacit response is 'it must suck to lose that badly'.  I cant take it anymore. We're winning too much. Oh god.
This sounds like something I would say ironically to deliberately sound stupid.
That bird is majestic as fuck. 
I sadly think this gives CNN more credibility. They have fallen so far that an honest report is refreshing.
This has to be a joke. Sauce?
That bird looks fucking sick, actually.
Neither CNN nor Shitfeed mean anything. Both are barren, discredited, unreliable and devoid of energy.  
Well, this pheasant looks majestic AF, so thanks CNN?  >"Trump hair in the front, medieval samurai in the back"  Is that an insult? 
Filthy liberal here. I gave up on CNN when they considered the possibility that a black hole was the reason for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. 
That bird is glorious as fuck, that's what it is

Jokes aside, the hair does look a lot like Trump.
Holy shit ... we need to buy one and send it to Donald as a gift.
CNN is like a headless chicken running round in circles before it drop dead.
This "story" by CNN is pretty fowl.
Once they lose their press credentials, they'll go full tabloid...

CNN and liberal media got you "The Donald" as president elect
But a mayor had to resign for saying Michelle Obama looks like an 'ape in heels'...
Lol "news" 
This country is imploding.
Even that bird wants to put a wall between him and these dumbasses
The question is now that the Clinton crime family is swimming frantically in a septic tank, their collective lungs are rapidly filling with liquid shit, they'll soon sink out of sight, and the Earth will be a better place…  *what will the initials CNN then stand for?*    Because the outfit will doubtless carry on (at least for a while) after their namesake is dissolving in the aforementioned septic tank, and we need to know what to call them.
That bird will Make America Great Again!
More like compare Trump to an animal its funny. Compare Obama to gorilla which is a slur you're racist.
I once created a post on the_donald, using "GUYS", the pedes reminded me that it's slightly sexist not saying "guys and gals". Just saying.
[deleted]
Isn't CNN considered "fake" news though?
Did they just assume my gender?
Haha guys, this monkey looks like Obama
Michele Obama kinda looks like a....... oh wait dont want to be racist forgot about that double standard :O
That bird is frickin' gorgeous.
It's going to be 4 years of headlines like that on CNN.  Boycott the fuck out of them.  I took them off my Favorites bar last year after all the Trump bashing.
The truth is, this is exactly what happened. Remember back 10+ years ago when people started to blog and journalists complained that blogging wasn't real journalism? In the pursuit of ad revenue, legitimate news organizations, instead of beating them, joined them.
That actually is kinda funny.  If i compared Obama to Curious George I'd probably get lynched though.
Well... I'm just going to take that as a compliment. The Golden Pheasant looks as dignified and majestic as President Trump. So there!!!!!
Hey, it's a badass bird. Hair for flair and armor for battle.  Perfect package to MAGA.
I was offered an internship at Buzzfeed about 2 years ago. I game with someone who worked at buzzfeed and he needed to hire an intern. He bothered me and tried to pressure me into applying. Like telling me I have to decide within 24 hours.   Basically, he wanted me to become a video editing monkey. I am a youtuber and he wanted to basically make me a slave lol. I didn't like Buzzfeed because it was just a giant feminist circle jerk.   Could it been some good experience and something good on my resume? Probably.. but I would not enjoy the 3-6 months of work.
Obama does look a bit like a chimpanze with his big ears out.
Hey guys, look, [I found a bird that looks like Hillary!](http://imgur.com/a/Ms7BA).
well the pheasant in question seems to be doing a lot better than this poor chicken: https://sli.mg/24FlCr  looks like she lost a shoe or two on the way down to her faceplant too. unfit.

Misleading title, if cnn devolved they'd be a single cell organism.
To be fair... That is a very good looking pheasant. I would consider it a bend of the knee that CNN has to write about pictures of animals in my likeness in order to get views, shares, likes, etc. 
medieval samurai.....cmon CNN 
Is CNN proposing a new national bird in honor of our god emperor? More at eleven.

/u/spez, go fuck yourself.  Sincerely, People with common sense.  (And suspend me jackass I fucking dare you)
We're going to have to change tactics to guerrilla redpilling.  You can never win a guerrilla war with conventional tactics...
You can't kill an idea. This is blatant censorship that is targeted to this community specifically. No matter how hard you try suppress this place, it will be heard. 
So basically... "I abused my power as CEO and discriminated against TD.  In response to my actions, I will discriminate more against this sub and take no responsibility nor consequences for my own actions except to say I pinky swear not to do it again."  Wow.
Altering the algorithm wasn't enough to stop us. Now they ban us, and only this sub, completely from /r/all. We're like a second reddit now they can't stop with fair actions.
Achtung! Der Fuhrer User Speztler has declared Totalen Krieg against der toxic trolls of Der_Donald!

I archived this as to combat Brigading.  If this is bannable, mods, please let me know.   _________________ I asked about /r/EnoughTrumpSpam and why they are allowed to oust our users in their posts?  This causes Brigading and constant harassment.  Downvoted immediately. I won't link it if it can cause me to get banned.
Fuck /u/spez
who's this cunt ?
He doesn't say whether this applies to **all** subs or not.  Edit: looks like were completely filtered out of r/all results. 
Not only are our stickies not showing up on r/all, nothing is, my r/all says it's filtered yet I have nothing filtered and there is no content from r/the_donald anywhere, this is disgusting. 
I think the mods shouldnt sticky anything for the time being...
>I spent my formative years as a young troll on the internet  This happens every fucking time. Some asshole pretends to be an internet-stupid normie who is totally caught off guard and traumatized by the mean ol' trolls online... except the "normie" knew exactly what they were doing and understood all of the dynamics perfectly because he or she was a "former" troll.   The EXACT same shit happened with gamergate. The people who cry online abuse are almost always abusers themselves who simply received blowback from the internet for acting like a jackass. It's the same DARVO crybullying bullshit that I'm beginning to associate very strongly with the left.

What a pedo-cucking fuck. 
To be honest I think this is a good thing BUT with the caveat that it should apply to all stickies, not just us. 
Why doesn't reddit just become Tumblr and be done with it? 
I guess this is what happens when you allow an actual pedophile/cannibal to CEO the 27th largest website out there. Who would have thought a piece of shit person would turn this website into a piece of shit as well, I mean who saw that coming? /s  FUCK u/spez
Liberal censorship.  When will they learn.

Good. If they want to live in an echo chamber, let them.

>This whole experience has been pretty painful.  Poor CEO guy. So much pain. So much suffering.  >Even with the best of intentions, I (we) won't do this again.  How would anyone even know if you did?

Just ours! Every other subreddits stickies will still show up!
This is fine. It will only cause another spike in subscriptions. I'm honestly getting tired of winning.

That figures. Let me lay it out. I used to read reddit avidly, as a lurker. I was disgusted as these horrible brainless political posters turned the entirety of reddit into a cesspool of whining shitposts. I started spending less time on reddit. I found The_Donald by the controversies, and as I read, I was glamoured by the spicey memes. While that was going on, I saw these same memes ridiculously blackballed out there in normie-ville. As it turned out, the entirety of Reddit became such a giant ball of whiney crybully shitstormers, I logged on so I could post here as I was so fucking disgusted by their cosmic dissonance I needed to raise my voice in a sea of sanity. That is why I am here. Oh, and by the way u/spez -- I no longer even read any part of the rest of reddit. Your little filter bubbles are no longer livable for lifeforms.
So now we know reddit is a liberal website that wants to suppress conservative views.  im pretty new to being a regular user of reddit, this has surprised me, its very sad.  i have been on here daily for months now and i have never seen anything offensive reach /all from the_donald.  surely they cant be referring to pepe the frog memes etc? surely that cant offend anyone :\ if that is the case thats so dam sad..
OUR STICKIES WON'T SHOW UP, BUT OUR POSTS WILL...  Currently 3 posts of /r/the_donald on /r/all  We don't need stickies, we just need to organization.
Unfuckingbelievable. 
Just make all stickies direct links to unsticked posts. Boom easy day.

Meh, I don't think this will change much. Most people on Reddit are probably already aware of T_D. The majority of this sub's growth comes from outside sources, like during the God emperor's AMA, when we were in the news for pizzagate, etc.
Why don't we post on super-freedom-friendly Voat.co and link to it from here?  Really should start the transition
#I guess liberals don't care about popular votes after all
Just sticky a thread that directs to the thread to upvote. Would that work?
This would not be an issue if this wasn't something that effected literally just us.
Its a shame because outsiders have admitted to liking the stickies.
i went to r/all and a the_donald post is 4th.   i don't see it.  when is it supposed to take effect?
maybe you should start finding a new forum...he's going to ban you guys sooner or later
I think its about time to wrap up this shit show thats become reddit, and we go find a new community or whatever it is we're going to do once we get kicked out of here completely.
/u/spez is a cuck

Why does /u/spez look just like Derz from workaholics? 
fuck /u/spez
Delurking in a fit of cold rage (after months of reading in admiration and delight as you transAtlantic cousins win your freedom). The censorious are always so smug, so certain, so puffed up with self-righteousness. And they never, ever foresee the consequences of sending highly engaged, self-motivated and self-educating people to a gulag, literal or virtual. I find I have another, pre-red pill reddit account, all clean and innocent and nice, with liberal karma and all.  I think it's time to put it to work with a little subtle missionary work on other subreddits. Anyone else have one that could do likewise?
What if the mods sticky a post let it get insane amounts of upvotes and then unsticky it? Won't it shoot up to r/all?
Spez is a cuck.
>The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, **which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.**  More of the same. Redefine the meaning of words to justify your actions. 
If stickies are not meant to be used to get extra votes why not make it site wide 
There is a way around this. Have both stickies be new link posts to the posts they want to sticky. This way, we just have to click on the sticky and then upvote ;)
Isn't /r/all supposed to show the best of ALL subreddits?   Meaning that if a The_Donald post gets enough upvotes it should show up right? Filtering and blocking defeats the purpose of /r/all  I guarantee if /r/sandersforpresident posts flooded the front page there would be no issue. But we are guilty of the horrendous crime of disagreeing politically

They feel so small and threatened that they must rely on their position in a company to defend their cuck beliefs. Absolutely void of intellectual rebuttal. Forever cucked!
I expect someone will write a browser plugin to automatically downvote spez now. 
I love how he paints himself as brave for using his admins powers against users he doesn't like. It just shows how deluded he is that even as the ceo he still thinks himself the victim.

Idiot cucks don't realize every time they do this, we just grow stronger.  That'll be worth about another 20,000 centipedes when this gets out to the blogopshere/media.
/r/Mr_Trump needs to reopen ASAP  I like the contigency plan of opening multiple different subs and making them active. /r/the_donald can be our homebase if the admins want to shield them from it so badly.

I guess we just have a leak out in the general reddit. Occupy pics, videos, aww, movies, worldnews, funny. It's not hard, we just have a bit of attention on the /new/ sections of some of the popular default subs and upvote anything woke. 
Ideas are bulletproof
"I'm sorry i got caught" - Democrat playbook pg 2. 
I wonder if we should ban /r/all from our front apge
I'm here from /r/all so it's obviously not banned completely. 
We black market now  "It's illegal in nine countries. Yep, it's made with bits of real MAGA, so you know it's good."
I believe that you can now filter any sub from r/all. It's not a ban against JUST this one. The user has the option to filter any sub from r/all.   
Their mods won't even answer me. I've asked them several times why I can't post because I've never gotten a ban notice.

Japan not taking in refugees; says it must look after its citizens first. How many people protested them?
[deleted]
Same here in South Korea. Apparently about 900 Syrian refugees came here since 2012 but only 7 of them so far got officially accepted as refugees.  P.S) We already have North Korean defectors to take care of so why do we have to accept refugees from far-away Arab country?  edit: year

As a pede from Singapore, a country with an absolute ZERO TOLERANCE refugee immigration policy, I really struggle to understand why Western liberals want to bring in millions of potential threats into their countries. It's absolutely ridiculous from the perspective of this side of the world. 
SJW do indeed protest, but that's either here in the West or a handful of expats in Tokyo. But they do exist and they want Japan to become just as culturally enriched as the West. They cannot stand the thought of an industrialized nation not committing cultural suicide. The pressure on Japan will only grow the closer we get to the 2020 Olympics, and then it will be a full-on assault (that is, assuming the SJW haven't been completely destroyed by then).  Your title is thin ice - we will take it as a call to also not take in too many refugees, but the leftists will take it as a call to arms to eradicate the Japanese culture and people just as they want to do with us.

Safest country in world, great economy, good healthcare, almost entire population is ethnically linked. Not a bad deal being Japanese. Also, being xenophobic over there is the norm and you can speak about it rationally. Theresa May of the UK started talking about limiting immigration and a shit storm occurred this week. The US will have no culture soon; go to big cities and if you are white you are barely or not a majority yet every race openly hates you. I hate this country, well most of it. 
Japan is an extremely genocentrist culture. They are openly racist to non-Japanese people within their country.  The Far East will be the last bastion of Western culture if the Left's constant kowtowing of Islam doesn't stop.
Japan was like "alright. We'll dip our toe into this "tolerance" shit. See what happens." And then their women started getting raped.   Japan has common sense. 
Average IQ of Japan:  107  Average IQ of Democrats:  about half of that. 
Glorious Nippon
Im Japanese, and culturally its really different there. The economy is already tough there and doesn't need to bring in any refugees. Japanese people are peaceful as hell, and when I was there the only people killing innocent people were foreigners, or military. They aren't going to bring in any allah akbar mother fuckers, because they r not stupid cucks.
Where is it written that we have to let in thousands and thousands of refugees every year?  It's like this thing no one is allowed to stop, lest you be called a racist.  Good for Japan, my guess is they haven't had too many Islamic attacks either.
My wife is Asian, these people are the most Racist SOBs I've ever met lol  White people are OK, the rest they consider garbage.
This is why **Donald-san** is right !
Neither is [china](https://refugeeresettlementwatch.wordpress.com/2016/02/28/china-takes-no-syrian-refugees-for-several-important-sensible-reasons/)   For some reason only the West is trying to self flagelate themselves with a hostile culture and destroy their nations from the inside 
Cuz there's no Whiney pussies in Japan. Japan has its shit together. 
I just love how places like the UK, Cuckada, Germany, etc are all weighing in and doing stuff like the "stop trump from seeing the queen" shit. Do they not see how imperialist it is to try and stop a sovereign nation from blocking refugees? Seriously, fuck off already.
They get a pass because we NUKED THEM.   Oh, they committed atrocities across all of Asia? They were monstrous occupiers who ruined the lives of the conquered peoples? THEY LEARNED IT FROM WHITES.   IT'S THE USA'S FAULT. To atone, we must take in even more refugees

This is from 2015.  Have they changed their stance since?  
Stupid liberal: But we shouldn't base America's freedoms on Japanese culture!  Other stupid liberal: Don't offend Asia!
Japan sounds like a decent place to live
Japan, and most of east asia is what leftists always ignore. Super racist, Japan first in everything. Basically no permanent immigration. Yet leftists don't seem to care at all. 
[deleted]
But, but, but its cute Japan?! How can it be criticized?  Double standards are strong.
But America had slavery once, therefore we have no ground to stand on. Oh and also white people..../s  We are always demonized for doing exactly what other countries do because everyone wants to take advantage of us and nc the Democrats love selling us off
Well of course no one will piss and moan about it because Japan isn't the ol' US of A where we're just supposed to be all lovey dovey with the world and just let them all ram us in the ass with their refugees and we just turn around and just give them money and healthcare and handouts.  [This is how many refugees the United States should allow.  Plain and simple.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V3CfD8TPac)
Don't forget though that as great as Japan is, they benefit greatly from partnering with the US. We can be great together, and we can learn from each other. I think the US needs to learn from Japan and be more nationalistic, safer, more disciplined, and Japan needs to create its own military.

Duh - only America needs to commit Country-Suicide, because we're white (despite being a melting pot of multiple races?) Liberals are dumb
We already have too many foreigners and refugees in fact.
The ctrl left loves anime too much to ever speak against Glorious Japan
They're not white and therefore diverse.
Japan is smart.
I really love how it's ok for asians in general to love their country and their heritage. Shame how we can't doe the same here 
The scary little truth that none of the SJW or the left want to acknowledge is that racial minorities are exponentially more racist than White Males.  Japanese hate Koreans, that hate Chinese, that hate Mongolians, etc.    It goes on and on.  But White Males are racist because we can't tell the difference between Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Mongolians, etc.    Personally, I don't care what you are.  You're "Asian", and that's fine.  But YOU can tell and care the difference between Japanese and Chinese. The whole thing is ridiculous.  Oh, by the way, the "Asians" hate "the blacks" and the Mexicans more than "The Whites" do.  And, the Mexicans hate the Blacks more than the Whites do.    All of these minorities hate each other far more than the supposed "Majority White" hates any of them.    
We aren't Japan pedes, Japan is a homogenous ethnic state and they don't take kindly to mixing of ethnicities and cultures. The US is fundamentally different.

This is exactly how I feel we as Americans must do. We need some time to tend to ourselves for a bit.
BASED JAPAN 
"The Japanese are all racist white men and Nazis!"
Last Summer I had an internship offered by UC schools to go "empower" high school kids in Japan. So many liberals made the cut and one of them gave a whole presentation on how we MUST let the refugees in to save them. She played a cheesy video with shots of women and children and sad music playing in the background. It was so manipulative and disgusting that she would try to persuade them with that.  Talking to the Japanese teachers and parents it was clear however that the consensus was not to let refugees in. Many of the kids too didn't want to let them in. Thank goodness the Japanese high school students weren't susceptible to the liberal propaganda being pushed by the American students.
Sorry but fuck refugees, they shouldnstay and fight their war and win their country back.
Japan has PLENTY of problems to deal with already without being a goddamn soup kitchen and hospital for millions of other people. Once they get things like high suicide rate and declining population under control they can think about charity work. 
Wow, a  country that looks after it's own first. I am SHOCKED and APPALLED!
One of the things I love about Japan is that while Godzilla keeps destroying its cities, it generally has a kind of immunity from cuckzilla attacks. 
Once the SJW/cultural marxists are done with white people, they will go after the Asians. That is why I joined the Trump side because I am Asian. Asians are not very high on the SJW social hierarchy of oppressed/victims.

Like most things, it's only bad when white people do it.

NO MORE RAPEFUGEES
Why should countries on the extreme opposite of the planet take in refugees? Let assfuckistan, their neighbors only a few dozen or hundred miles away, with similar culture and language, take them in. It's insane to fly them around the globe just to support them as they produce nothing and breed exponentially. 
Cuckugees should be rejected.

What is with the lefts fascination of erasing their cultural identity? That's the exact thing Japan is fighting against, and I agree with them. I don't think it's unreasonable to want your family line to continue, and the country you helped build to continue existing in its current form. 
It's because Japan has always been pretty nationalistic. Some would argue that they're xenophobic and racism too - I don't know about that, but it's whatever. Basically though, this is part of their culture and they've always had a lot of pride in their country. Unlike America, they don't go out and try to solve the world's problems; they have a me-first mentality. And I'll be willing to bet that's the main reason they've been ahead of us in technology and haven't had nearly as many crime-related problems.
THis is what I cannot understand... Japan, saudi arabia, many african nations, and several european nations races are are all over 90%+ one race and nobody bitches at them about it... but if america wants to keep it's majority race from becoming a minority we are the bad guys... why is that??? 
Neither will South Korea and many oyher countries. Only Americans protesting as far as I can see.
Not only does Japan have extremely tough immigration laws, it also has a culture that doesn't cater to outsiders. They expect you to assimilate.   Yet no one ever gives Japan hell, js. 
I believe Japan welcomes the new Administration because Japan is and always has been for self-determination-i.e. nationalism. Now, for the first time in a few generations, the US is representing this and it is very much in Japan's interest that the US succeeds against the tide of national dissolution because Japan was the next target of the multikult nation destroyers. I think in the coming months and years we will see Japan be a strong ally of this administration. These deals are evidence of that. 
Wtf I hate anime now 
Japan doesn't have libtards like we do.  Maybe we can deport our liberals there. 
Nobody would protest when Japan does it.  That would mean they'd have to disown their dakimakuras.
There was a small amount of whining about it at the time.  Not much, though.  Japan doesn't have a "fifth column" of its own citizens trying to destroy it.  (Which, actually, is probably why they've been stuck in a slump for decades.)
Bottom line: who gives a shit about protests? I am concerned with the law. These bleeding hearts can go pound sand and chew soap.  America First. Unabashedly. Unapologetically.
Japan never lets me down.
I was there recently, a bunch of people were protesting in the street against Abe & even saw a "No to Trump" sign. At least they only took up one lane, unlike leftist protesters in America who block up everything & smash things down
100 thumbs up.... Cucks give this the thumbs down and are crying right now..... Make it great   https://youtu.be/A15ix81V4uM

They're obviously racist.
Japan has an excellent immigration policy overall.
How many libtards protested Hungary for installing a fence back in 2016 to keep syrians out?  https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1455624/migrants-hungary-eu-fence.jpg
Wow a country putting it's citizens first!? We must riot to protest this blasphemy!  /s
too many whites hate and guilt their own race and there are entrenched minority groups, media, politicians, etc. here who reinforce and take advantage of that fact (i recognize this as a non-white)  why do they hate their own race? they were conditioned to through the media and educational systems that poisoned their minds with cultural marxism until it became part of their identity.   so the question is: who came up with and disseminated cultural marxism? 
The idea of taking in refugees is a very outmoded method of dealing with a humanitarian crisis.  Setting up safe zones in a country suffering from calamity is a smarter method.  No politician is willing to suffer the burden of having refugees live in their communities but demand it of the rest of us and our children.  Ted Kennedy was rabidly for offshore wind power, so long as it wasn't off his shore.  All these celebrities and elites want refugees; they will throw money at them, take pictures with them, kiss their babies, but they don't want to deal with them in their communities.  So we are not asked, but forced to shoulder the burden of their feels and photo-ops.  That burden is a price too high to ask of anyone.
Japan is very tough on immigration. Smart folks 
How many jihadi muslim terror attacks has Japan had in the last 100 years? lol.
>"I would say that before accepting immigrants or refugees we need to have more activities by women, by elderly people and **we must raise (the) birth rate.** There are many things that we should do before accepting immigrants"  #BASED DOLPHIN MERCHANTS: *BTFO ISLAM!*
Silly /r/the_donald, it's not racist when non-whites do it!
You'll notice no one talks about diversity in non-white countries. No one is pushing for any other countries to be "diverse" just for the sake of being diverse. Yea China needs a black president or their racist. Saudia Arabia needs more people of color. 
Japan gets a free pass from leftist weebs, who would have thought.
@realDonaldTrump: Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!
Every Trump tweet now seems that much more special!
Holy fuck he is going to TRIGGER the left so much with this tweet

He isn't even in office yet and people already treat him as the worst president ever. Give him a chance and judge by the results, if he follows through what he promised who knows, he might even make America great again.   The country is divided and the left is dividing it. Whoever is on the other side is bad, regardless what they do.
And here was me thinking being POTUS would stop him shit posting :)

He wants that evil troll Soros to put out money, expose himself more. This tweet might infuriate him. 7D Chess maybe?   Doesn't matter, I love this man. 
In a few weeks this man will be tweeting from the POTUS account.   Also he's done great for his presidential image so far. 
Playing 4-D Chess as usual.  This is the setup for something, he's setting bait with his tweets about protesters.  
Even while seeing people protesting against him.. He is seeing the bright side!

This is what a godlike unifying force of persuasion looks like folks. He reaches out to the other side inviting them to take a seat at the table and be a part of something greater. Something significant. He's not going to divide us with identity politics, he'll bring us together and evoke our similarities. THIS IS WHAT A PRESIDENT DOES, MR. OBAMA. It's a shame that you didn't learn that in all your time as a constitutional law professor, community organizer and 8 years as POTUS.
Fixing America can't stop the madman from shitposting against the smug liberals that can't accept the results of democracy. 
They will soon lose steam, it's just unsustainable.

Brilliant.  1. calls them small to diminish them 2. admires them - induces cognitive dissonance (we're anti trump but he likes us?!) 3. demonstrates that he wants unity and progress and puts the onus on them for stopping that from happening 4. D chess
First time commenter in r/the_donald.  I'm a die-hard Clinton supporter.  I worked for Obama's campaign as a canvasser and am proud of his achievements.  These protesters are silly, and I think Trump's reaction to them is so far admirable.  Folks on the left need to give him a bit of the benefit of the doubt.  Protest once he's done something you don't like.  Don't protest just because he won.  I just wanted to stop by here and say that I'm hoping for the best.  I have strong policy disagreements with the president elect, and am nervous about some of the people he's saying he'll put into powerful positions.  That said, we have a process for electing a president, and he came out the winner in that process. I respect that process, and I respect anyone who participated in it (I have much less respect for those who decided to sit this one out on either side).    So good luck to everyone! 
Legendary tweet status 
Diffusing this situation with kindness really gives them no leg to stand on, and is a very wise - avery presidential - move.
Trump doing the "Agree and Amplify"  We are witnessing historic times
*sigh* This is the first post I have ever liked on this sub. Just gotta get used to the idea that Trumps gonna be president and hopefully he tries to heal all this craziness and divide. 
I'm on the left but this tweet doesn't seem like an attack. In fact I totally appreciate this tweet and it changed my mind on the type of person Trump is.
Russia and Syria have publicly announced wanting peace with US. Israel's Prime Minister announced that they want to repair the damaged relationship between them and the US. DOW closed today at an all-time high. Canada and Mexico have announced they are willing to renegotiate NAFTA with the US. All in two days of electing Trump. Bad week for SJWs, great week for America and the world.
God damn i can't wait for these presidential as fuuck tweets to come from @POTUS
Charge George Soros with domestic terrorism, problem solved.  I'm convinced FBI already got all the evidence needed, but Obama is protecting him. 
A smart tweet. He indirectly acknowledges their grievances without being critical of them and calls for everyone to unite to make America a better place.
I'm really liking his tone since Wednesday morning. He's coming across as very respectful and interested in unity. I hope this continues and his opponents come to share this goal with him.
Trump to George Soros: "What you are doing is both insignificant and trivial."
The Mad King!
Does this superhuman ever sleep?
What if I told you it was Barron behind these tweets?
#4D CHESS
#**SHITPOSTING JUST BECAME 10% MORE SUBTILE**

I like it. He calls them out in one tweet then offers them encouragement in another. It'll take some time for cooler heads to prevail, but I think he'll be the great uniter. He's a "say hard truths" statesman. The world had been lacking one since Churchill.

More and more Evidence/indicators are coming in that these Protests are not organic, and are pre-planned, large scale organized(such as being bussed around and ordered on the ground), 100% Soros/DNC created and that Hillary gave the order to activate.  BLM was a test run for these Protests and shares alot of similarities tactics wise. If you consider the O'Keefe videos this looks like a large scale "incident violence at rally's using crazy people" aswell.

"small groups"  I'm going to love this man. He's subtly taking the steam out of the emotional reaction. SO much better than Obama who stands there and openly recognizes violent protests as "Americans who are upset".  Job of president is not to acknowledge movements based on division. It is to prevent that and support the idea that we are all American. Trump is already doing that.
Seriously guys, reverse psychology is all we need to silence liberals. They just want to be the opposite of conservatives.  So imagine what they would do if conservatives set up a fund to help underprivileged minorities get access to abortion services and birth control?  They would freak out and call it genocide. Yet, that is exactly the type of shit they support.

Nor may §6(b); that is, such a person may not be excluded pursuant to §6(b), even if the 50,000-person cap has been reached or exceeded. As applied to all other individuals, the provisions may take effect.   (Disclaimer: IANAL)   The gist... SCOTUS has stayed the lower courts injunction until they can hear the full case in October.  The stay allows the travel ban to apply to anyone who cannot "credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States". What does that mean?  > The facts of these cases illustrate the sort of relationship that qualifies.   > **For individuals, a close familial relationship is required.** A foreign national who wishes to enter the United States to live with or visit a family member, like Doe’s wife or Dr. Elshikh’s mother-in-law, clearly has such a relationship.   > **As for entities, the relationship must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading EO–2**. The students from the designated countries who have been admitted to the University of Hawaii have such a relationship with an American entity. So too would a worker who accepted an offer of employment from an American company or a lecturer invited to address an American audience.  > **Not so someone who enters into a relationship simply to avoid §2(c)**: For example, a nonprofit group devoted to immigration issues may not contact foreign nationals from the designated countries, add them to client lists, and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion.   
oh lawdy, the redacted thread is like a real life tendies meme right now.  "wtf I thought Obama's judges were on our side, how did they vote for this"?  They literally have no concept that supreme court judges are supposed to impartially rule on constitutional issues instead of creating laws to fit with their political leanings.
Stop Dr. Mr. President I can't take all this winning!!!
Since there seems to be confusion regarding the dissent of Gorsuch, Alito, and Thomas...  Their resoning for dissent is that the full travel ban should have been allowed to go into effect, instead of just most of it. They weren't against the ban.
winning continues  no brakes
The irony here is if the 9th circus hadn't interfered, the original travel ban would have expired.

Based Supreme Court
Cue Reddit meltdown in 3...2....1....
6-3 decision with Gorsuch partially concurring and dissenting. How much should we bet that redacted makes it sound like this is all Gorsuchs fault and if we had let Obama pick someone the exact same thing wouldn't have happened?  Also wonder if they're tired of losing yet?  EDIT: Link for decision from SCOTUS https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-1436_l6hc.pdf

The 9th Circuit Court got overruled? How incredibly unexpected and unusual!  EDIT: Wow, it was unanimous too. Even the liberal judges agreed that the lower courts were grossly out of line. 9th Circuit BTFO.
Oh you mean the president can invoke powers clearly given to him, what a odd thought
#HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  *(inhales)*  #HAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAAHAH  #ISLAM IS CANCER, GO FUCK YOURSELVES 9th Circuit!
Just in from CNN:  "Supreme Court Upholds Travel Ban Injunction"  (because it does for a couple hundred people)
Shouldn't the judges that blocked the ban be removed for making an unconstitutional, indefensible decision?  It shows they have no understanding of our constitution and should not be making legal decisions impacting the laws of our land.
I'm sure as shit surprised this isn't on the front page, or being splashed all over the news sub.    I mean, when it was ruled against Trump, it certainly was......
The left has to be ready to have a conniption by now.

I got into so many arguments with liberals over this to which their only defense was, 'Well the courts have decided. Are you better/smarter than a judge?' I bet they change their tune real fast now.
Que the cucks, Dems and MSM. Libtard attorney's filling BS motions, airport protests and CNN making up BS stories about some kid from one of the banned countries needing a root canal in the U.S..   All the while ignoring the fucking fact the President has the constitutional authority to enact such a ban, and we have no way to properly vet these people. But those are insignificant to the liberal mind who still thinks this country is founded on feelings not laws.
Even though the 90 days has LONG passed this was important to establish that the President does indeed have that power
The anti-Donald Trump activist judges on the lower courts couldn't get one justice on the Supreme Court to agree with them on travel ban ruling.
9-0 with no dissents. How can this possibly go against him in October?
Unanimous. Even the judges who lean left.  /r/redacted on suicide watch.

It still blows my mind that these people are getting upset over a ban on people coming into the country from places that are incubators for Islamic terrorism.

If Trump wins this, we will 100% get Trump next election :)    And Sanders will be in prison at the time for bank fraud hahhahah    THE BEST TIME LINE!!!
Reddit discussion really sucks around Trump. People here clearly have no clue what this EO even is or what it's based on. The "Muslim ban" includes countries with whom the US doesn't have acceptable information sharing about their citizens and are close to the ISIS conflict regions thereby being identified as an entry point threat for terrorists. If you read the actual EO, it doesn't just come up with the 6 Muslim majority countries on a whim but references the INA subsection that lists the countries previously identified as terror risks and with which we do not possess proper information clearing Specifically, the suspension applied to countries referred to in, or designated under, section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12) It was not based on religion or anything else. In fact it was the Obama administration that identified these countries, not Trump.
About time, Thank you Mr. President. Nice to see the Constitution being correctly recognized again.
EXTREME VETTING BITCHES Get some more bricks.
Being a lib continues to be the worst imaginable choice one could make.
It's almost as if the president has the responsibility and power to protect our citizens from foreign threats!   Fucking crooked ass leftist federal judges who would even DARE to compromise the safety of this country for bullshit political virtue signaling. DRAIN THE SWAMP.
And Donald Trump just surpassed Floyd Mayweather in winning streaks.
Have people forgotten Both the Bush Administration and the Obama administration had similar if not these exact countries on a list of Travel Ban to America! It was fine then but as Soon as Trump has it hes the criminal? What gives? 
Chicago Police: 4 in custody after young man tortured on Facebook Live (During the video you hear them say "Fuck Donald Trump" and "Fuck White People" this is a hate crime.)
Can't be a hate crime--the victim is white and the attackers are black. Check your privilege!
MSM is gonna sweep this under the rug the first article I found doesn't mention at all about it being politically and racially motivated.
Please JUST IMAGINE the situation if a group of whites kidnapped and tortured a black shouting "Fuck black people, fuck Obama!"  Instant leading international news story and a live Obama press conference etc.   DO NOT LET THIS SLIDE

Nice knife you have there, want to bring it to the white house?
So...A bunch of threads of this incident on All and News was just removed...Fucking seriously Reddit?
It's even worse. The kid these animals kidnapped and tortured was a special needs person. These fucks deserve to live the rest of their lives in a prison and then go to hell. 
Last place I ever thought I would be posting but this is ridiculous. This is literally a hate crime and it's being ignored.
Our complicit MSM deserves full recognition for their role in the wave of hate crimes post-election.  Holmes' opinion from Schenck v. United States (Shouting "FIRE!" in a crowded theater) seems to reasonably apply to the sensationalist fear-mongers that the MSM have devolved into since the Clintons last occupied the White House.

How do we make sure justice is served and these people see jail time? I have a bad feeling that they will get off lightly because it's Chicago and they know white people won't riot when a lenient verdict is delivered
If Cook County prosecutors don't go hard on these thugs, Trump's DOJ needs to investigate. Cook County criminal justice is a fucking joke. 
America, this is what real hate looks and sounds like, not a "microaggression" or hoaxed "hate crime." You can't hide the truth forever! Truly sad this crime was perpetrated though.
2:15 http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/04/us/chicago-facebook-live-beating/index.html hoooooooooooly shit...... this is so ridiculous. they say "fuck trump" "fuck white people" how can you say you don't know the motive.
CNN is now claiming the white guy was targeted because he was handicapped. Chicago won't let itself be the home of "black Supremest Hate Crimes". history being rewritten as-it-happens.

Heads must roll for this. 
This only ensures a second President Trump term. . . 
I'm a center-left guy and not very fond of Donald Trump, but I'm fucking disgusted by this. This is 100% a hate crime and should not be tolerated. My heart goes out to this victim, and this story deserves to be heard. Idiots like this are causing this country to become so divisive. I know the far right gets a lot of flak from the left for being bigoted, or racist, but this is an example of the political horseshoe. These 4 essentially mirror what they despise and are huge hypocrites. Another problem with this is the far left's mentality of "all conservatives are racist and whatever." Then stuff like this comes out and triggers a similar reaction from the far right "all liberals are like this". This type of ignorance and sweeping generalization from either side are a huge issue, and these torturers are adding greatly to the problem. That is why extremists like these disgust me, left or right. They deserve to be locked up for a long time.
https://youtu.be/rfzvrCwjfLE  Oohhh now you fucked up! 
These scum are going to jail for a long long time
I usually don't even post but when the police are saying that they don't even know IF this is a hate crime is such bullshit. The fact that he was made to do things on video to send a message pretty much seals this as not only a hate crime but an act of terrorism. This was made to send a message, If they get off light you will see more people thinking that they can get away with this type of action.
Speaking as a Bernie/Jill supporter, I am so sorry that this happened to one of you. Just know that are a lot of "lefties" like me who are deeply ashamed and disgusted by this senseless act of violence.  Wishing this young man all the best, I hope he will get all the support/help/medical treatment he needs.  Again, I am so sorry.   :(
Just a shout out to the based BLACK concerned citizen who reported these black racist criminals! Grab a coat!
The media swept that thanksgiving story about that white woman who was chucked to the side of the road after being kidnapped too. No one heard much about it if they don't pay attention like we do. That was a hate crime by Latinas too.

Last straw--just deleted my FB account.
Don't care to watch video, or get irritated by reading some article.  Just 1 question.  Is there a reason the guy is alive? Did they just eventually let him go?
Hate crime shouldn't be a thing. It is in contrast to the concept of equal protection under the law. It is special protection under the law. The crime should stand alone, criminalization of the motive is criminalization of thought. BUT, AS LONG AS THIS STUPID CONCEPT IS ACTUAL LAW IT MUST BE APPLIED EQUALLY. Reverse the roles...hate crime without question.
we need to riot and protest if they do not get charged with a hate crime. if the races were reversed and they were saying "fuck blacks and fuck obama" everyone knows they would be charged with a hate crime. the way the chicago police talked about them being just 18 year old kids and maybe just ranting makes it look like they are gonna just get a slap on the wrist.  
Broken window theory...  Basically the vitriol and utter viciousness that the left slung at people who voted for a specific nominated candidate has created a sense of permissiveness among degenerates emboldening them to act this way, the phrase "he voted for Trump" has become a justification slogan to commit violence.   Liberals created these monsters, gave them permission to act this way and the media reinforced it.   I'm wondering where are the videos of increased racism and violence against minorities that the left promised would increase if Trump won? Seems to me all the destruction, racism, violence, rioting and hate is coming from their side... just saying.    
If the state level courts can't do their job, the federal government needs to widen the range on eligible crimes that reach federal jurisdiction. Put the fear of federal prison time, with federal courts having 95%+ conviction rates, and watch crime go down -- both from deterrence and not letting these scum fucks out of jail over and over.
There's a pic in /pol/ of what looks like a mug shot of the girl who was recording the whole thing.   It's not really justice for this horrific act, but it's a start. 
I wonder how Obama will address this in his speech in Chicago on the 10th?   Oh, right. It's a white guy. He won't. Money says clock boy or the gentle giant come up though. 
DEATH PENALTY! KILL THESE MOTHER FUCKERS

It's funny that the MSM is trying to down play this horrible act already. Any article all just say "4 people" yelled racial slurs not the fact that they were black yelling "fuck white people"
i still say it's Mayor inspired *payback* for Trump tweeting they need the feds to come in and control their city
So the police already made up their mind that this is not a hate crime or politically motivated - just "boys being boys" basically.  It really makes me wonder how often hate crimes against whites goes unreported. 
What black people can't be racist   This kind of shit is what happens when you ignore a huge problem because of political correctness.   Jesus Fuck, poor guy.

Want to upset a liberal?  Then bring up this Wikipedia entry for Elon Musk:  >Musk has described himself as "nauseatingly pro-American". According to Musk, the United States is "[inarguably] the greatest country that has ever existed on Earth", describing it as "the greatest force for good of any country that's ever been". Musk believes outright that there "would not be democracy in the world if not for the United States", arguing there were "three separate occasions in the 20th-century where democracy would have fallen with World War I, World War II and the Cold War, if not for the United States".

I asked him why it was my job to inform him about his hero.  But, I would go back and find the articles I was thinking about.  Then I get on T_D and this is #2!  PRAISE KEK!!!
Elon Musk is a great man, and we can be happy to have him on board. I think his opinion alone will bring a lot of people to the table. 
I will admit when I first heard of T-Rex being selected I was very wary.  Oil man, Exxon-Mobile no less, with neo-con ties.  But T-Rex lives and breathes American, like the rest of us. And no one is better suited to helping us reach energy self-sufficiency better than the man who knows how the entire system runs, who the real players are.  Most importantly, I trust Trump's decisions. The President has earned my trust.  I have never said that about any other President ever.  Hell, by this time back in 2008, Barry Failure had already broken several promises.

It's amazing all the Twitter comments about how we should be worried about Putin's influence, or oil concerns influencing politics, as if the past two administrations didn't jump every time the Saudis moved their little finger.  The president actually openly sided with the extremist Saudi dictatorship against victims of 9/11, and nobody blinked.  The Saudi head of intelligence is an honorary Bush family member, and as sec of state and a presidential candidate, Hillary parroted the Saudi king's every wish regarding Syria.  But suddenly trump's critics feel "hopeless"?  The hypocrisy is mind boggling.

Elon's a smart guy and level-headed, even if he does overpromise on product.  I voted Clinton, but I still think Tillerson may end up being a good pick. At a bare minimum, he's knowledgeable of international affairs, even if I'm a bit concerned about the fact that he's coming from the private sector rather than spending some time as a diplomat first.  If only other Democrats would actually be level-headed about these things, maybe we wouldn't be in this situation.

This is awesome. A major roadblock in his success on his EV's was the Oil Industry.   No hard feelings after all that business they butted heads over.  Respect.
Can we start a thread for when the left shitting on Elon?? We all know it will happen and it will be hilarious. First the left shits on any black people who try to give trump a chance. Then they shit on his children. Now they'll be shitting on someone who has an incredible vision for the future that follows their environmental image. Mmmm
The best part is that this was an unprovoked tweet! It's not just a throw away comment in an interview, Elon actually had to go out of his way to tweet this.  
Honestly, we are all lucky Tillerson even considered taking the job. The man is a genius. Maybe Trump's best pick, after the general. 
Uh oh. Elon Musk likes Rex. Suddenly, all of reddit will love Rex.
Elon Musk "Rex Tillerson might not be so bad."  Liberals "Wtf I hate Tesla now."
But he mains Soldier 76 according to a follow up Post. Not sure how to feel about that.

People are literally turning on him in the replies, do you have any idea how much it would take for Mr electric to side with Mr oil? Jesus what the hell is going on
> Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA.  Fuck yeah.  
Liberals: "wtf i hate Musk now"
"Oh, The_Donald likes Elon Musk now? Well, I always hated the guy. He's clearly a corporatist, anti-science, right wing fascist." -The consistent left
Didn't vote for Trump and love Musk. But what I love most of all is objective opinions. I support the TPP move but don't support the abortion move, and that's okay. Musk supports the Secretary of State move, but probably not a handful of other things, hence the start of the tweet. Objective opinions are what will make America great again. Not one sided policies that get shut down cause the Left or Right don't agree with the Right or Left.
Hmmm, guy who Reddit regularly sucks the dick of agrees with something 'literally Hitler' did.    Interested to see how this plays out. 
Bernie praises Trump for killing TPP yesterday, and Musk backs Tillerson today. Half of reddit is going to have a stroke at this rate.
While Chicago was making community organizer sand San Fransisco was making anti-American activist, the city of Wichita Falls TX was making peacemakers
This just in, Reddit now will begin slandering and hating Elon Musk. The chess just keeps adding dimensions. Everything reddit held dear and said was either evil/fantastic (TPP/Musk) is being held up in parallel regard by Trump....but because it's Trump that means now the inverse is true. Delightful. Can't wait until I can afford a Tesla, I'm gonna drive the shit out of that motherfucker.
Clearly the important bit of information is that Elon mains Soldier 76.
The left has no problem turning on anyone that doesn't 100% agree with them. Anytime a liberal or dem says something nice about Trump or his supporters, or even just agrees with them, they deem them an enemy. Just because you're loud doesn't mean you're right. Its sad how quick they turn on ppl that won't follow their ideologies. Even their own feel shutout and censored. Look how often ppl who don't support Trump stop by to talk or get answers. I'd hate to have to walk on eggshells constantly and do appreciate the fact that I see ppl on here voicing their criticisms as well as their praises.
Incoming liberal tolerance.
Its only a matter of time before T_D becomes the most popular sub on reddit. One by one the lefty view of Pres. Trump will crumble as more leftist heroes like Musk show support. First Bernie agrees on TPP, now Elon on TRex. I give it 6-8 months maybe less and we'll see a YUUUUGE spike in subs here. r/redacted will pale in comparison.

Use your damn head in the future, like Elon is doing now instead of playing into the bullshit Never Trump rhetoric. Obviously it's a good idea to bring the leading innovator of renewable energy to the table. 
The bit of "dumb college liberal" thats still inside me was like "REEEE Rex Tillerson works for the evil oil company REEEE" but then I slapped myself in the face and realized no one knows geo-politics better then the head of the leading oil company in the world.  If Rex is a patriot he will use this knowledge to make America more powerful across the globe. Give the man a coat.

Sounds like a bit of a moot point.
Look around you. Do you see anybody anywhere saying they support him? A simple eye test can lead you to a pretty obvious conclusion that people here aren't supporting his actions.  All it takes to make claims like that is to have users who want to subvert this domreddit subscribe and start spewing whatever he wants to hear, and then use it to make false claims.   It's up to him to show proof of his statements by backing them up, not for us to have to debunk them. So where do you get off telling anyone to prove his claims validity? The fact that people here are straight up saying they don't support him are showing how what he said doesn't represent the sentiments here.

Point the pro-Trump news from Clinton's subreddit and we'll talk.
The whole point is that this subreddit is the only source of posts that counter the narrative from /r/redacted. Without the_donald, Reddit is nearly a 100% airtight left-wing echo chamber.
Dude we put stuff that isn't pro Trump all the time. We just archive it so they don't make any money.   We don't expect every news piece to be Pro-Trump, but the whole MSM is lying cancer that is anti-Trump.   Don't confuse how hard we push back when being lied to.
The New Algorithm Was Designed To Keep President Trump From The Front Page... But Sadly, That Won't Happen.

Up you go because fuck all those trying to put a ban on free speech.
This sub is getting brigaded hard... to no avail
Wait, where's the evidence that the new algorithm was design to keep The_Donald off the front page? How'd we get to this conclusion? 
Why do they do this shit? Trump is going to be the next President of the UNITED States of America and why is Reddit making it a bad thing to love our next president? Why is it a bad thing that democracy works and we the people got to pick Trump as our president? How crazy is it to censor that?

can someone explain the new algorithm to me?
That won't happen because /r/The_Donald **IS THE FRONT PAGE**
YOU CAN TAKE OUR STICKIES BUT YOULL NEVER TAKE OUR GOD EMPEROR
Eeh it will happen, and if it doesn't work they'll keep changing it until not a single The_Donald Post makes it to /r/All or the front page. btw try looking at Reddits front page/all page while in an incognito browser, (if you are logged in, it will skew the results based on your interests)
"Changed the algorythm to see a different form of content"... How is that ok?
THEY EVEN GOT THE FOUNDATION RIGHT IN THE PAINTING
What was this originally a portrait of? It is bothering me. Assuming photoshop.
If you look at all time we are censored off of it. On break so on my normal acct but on my work cpu donald stuff is nowhere
lol the loser ets obama thread got knocked off by high energy shitposts. nice. ctr failed again
Shitposting at 10am to liberals on r/highschoolpoliticos trying to trigger common sense and reasoning. It's a hard one.   There is someone in my inbox telling me how people with different skin colors should be self-governed in America to stop these racist crime statistics. This person said people of color other than whites cultures specifically do not value law and order, and thusly it is unfair for them to be governed bet a set of values that do.    Yes, I know, hell of a slice.

I asked them if it would be okay for the white-governed areas to make rules about the black people living among them, or if the ONLY federal laws applied would be anti-discrimination(since it is worse than murder).

I didn't vote for Trump and I can say I don't agree with him on a lot of things, and I don't always agree with the things posted on this sub. But I am strongly against censorship and 100% on your side on this. Regardless of political affiliation, beliefs, etc, censorship is bad news for everyone and this is something we should be fighting together.
I dislike Trump but have to concede the  fact that this picture is badass.  Props to whoever made it.

Stop putting **sadly** in the titles...
Trump should be honourarily inaugurated by US military.
I don't mean to sound paranoid here but in my experience every "They won't let The_Donald reach the front page" post I've seen has been in spot one, two, or three on the top of /r/all. I feel like this could easily be done by admins so that centipedes and just the average redditor don't believe that  certain posts from The_Donald are being censored or withheld from a front page position. Thoughts? Or am I just tinfoiling here

A portrait of not only OUR PRESIDENT - but of our KING!
America has no king. Never has, never will. But we do have DJT as president.   ##MAGA
#WE HAVE NO KING TRUMP WOULD REJECT SUCH A TITLE!!!
King? No. We fought a bloody war, in fields and swamps, with muskets and swords, to ensure that America is free of a king.  Donald is about to hold an Office way better than the king. An Office forged and defended by the blood of thousands of American patriots. He's going to be the President of the United States. That will forever be superior to any mere king. 
Down vote on the king thing fam, no Bueno 
Wrong. He's GOD EMPEROR!
I'm not a big fan of this title but I upvoted anyway because I love seeing the front pages flooded with this picture.
They artificially put it at 0            Oh well guess you got us...oh wait, Trump is still president.
Godspeed, comrade Russian Hacker!

In many years time, I will be in a moonlit wooden hut on a mountainside. The warm crackling fire, sitting at the end of a king-sized bed, illuminates the warm rug. The mattress is plump, raised to the right level. The sheets are thick, filled with soft feathers. A window gives a view of the idyllic scenery. A blanket of snow to match the blanket of feathers. A gazelle prances in the distance. My wife, my gorgeous redheaded wife, perfect figure, hair as red as wine and a gaze as intoxicating. She is as nude as the day she is born and just as messy. I have her across the bed, legs splayed out. Her womanhood bared to take my mighty trunk. For many hours we entwine, always rough, always sweaty. Finally with a quiver of the leg, my Aphrodite falls back, too exhausted to carry on despite her peak physical condition. I myself, of course, am still fully erect, but give her the moment to catch her breath. I hand her a diamond bottle of pure river water and she gratefully takes a sip to hydrate. Between breaths, she leans in and whispers to me, "Darling, I don't think I've ever seen your dick harder than it is right now." I turn to her, look deep into her eyes, and respond. "It's still not as hard as it was the first time I upvoted the pic of Trump riding a fucking tank"

TRUMP PUBLICALLY ANNOUNCES GENERAL JAMES MAD DOG MATTIS AS SEC OF DEFENSE
*"“I come in peace. I didn’t bring artillery. But I’m pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you fuck with me, I’ll kill you all.”*  *"“You cannot allow any of your people to avoid the brutal facts. If they start living in a dream world, it’s going to be bad.”*  - Gen. James D. Mattis
"“You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil. You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.""  THIS IS THE MOST BASED MAN IN THE COUNTRY
Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet. - Mattis  
Isis will soon be waswas
#The Golden Lion  #The Silver Fox  and now  # THE MAD DOG
Keep that shit in the room!
This is going to be the best of all of the appointments, and that's not because they others won't be great. Mattis is simply the best person possible for the job.   # “I come in peace. I didn’t bring artillery. But I’m pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you fuck with me, I’ll kill you all.”
Fuck yes. This is fucking awesome. If you're not aware of this wonderful man just go search, Mattis awesome quotes, you won't be disappointed.   Our military will be strong again not being pussified at every waking moment like Obama wanted. 
My husband is in the Air Force. His eyes almost popped out of his head when he heard the announcement. He's like, "Mad Dog Mattis is practically a patron saint to the marines!" (If you look up "Saint Mad Dog Mattis" you'll see some rather humor pictures of the guy.) There will be honor, glory and a right big stick for the military to beat the enemy with once again.  *wipes tear away*  And it's about damn time.
WHOA WHOA YOU LET IT OUT OF THE ROOM!!!
"Find the enemy that wants to end this experiment (in American democracy) and kill every one of them until they’re so sick of the killing that they leave us and our freedoms intact.”  - General Mattis   Sleep tight globalists
“When you men get home and face an anti-war protester, look at him in the eyes and shake his hand. Then, wink at his girlfriend because she knows she’s dating a pussy.”  Gen. James “Mad Dog” Mattis
https://youtu.be/3EYU3VTI3IU  15:32 What is the kill radius of your knife hands? Unexpected answer, true leader. SOD Mad dog!
[deleted]
I love the Marine Corps.  So cool to see a Marine's Marine get the job.  ISIS just shit a collective brick. 
The best part? Mattis has no wife and no kids. He is 100% business, 100% of the time. His devotion is to this country and this country alone. There could literally not be a better pick.
Fantastic choice.  Compare Mattis to some of the cucked European "Defense" Ministers.  No contest, folks.
People really need to take the time to read up on Mad Dog, beyond the headlines. He is possibly one of the most brilliant Strategic and Tactical minds of our time. He loves his Marines, Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen. This man truly loves this country, he's dedicated almost all of his life to it. 
#WE SHOULD STICKY A THREAD THAT LINKS TO THREADS SO WE DONT HAVE TO STICKY THEM FAM!
ISIS just got 10 caliphs smaller, folks! 
He's Batman: “Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.” 
#“The first time you blow someone away is not an insignificant event. That said, there are some assholes in the world that just need to be shot.”  #-Mattis  
ONE MIN. Sticky!!!!!!!
AM SCREAMING IN MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW, HAVE ALREADY ANNOYED MY FAM, CAN"T STOP SCREAMING THOUGH!!!  MATTIS, MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!!
This man is good for our times: "You cannot allow any of your people to avoid the brutal facts. If they start living in a dream world, it's going to be bad." 
Now thats a man that can grab ISIS by the pussy and shake them like a pitbull with a mouthful of poodle.
[deleted]
From a non-Trump voter, I gotta call a spade a spade when I see it. This is a great choice and perhaps could be one of the greatest SecDefs in a long,long time. I have tremendous respect for General Mattis (I posted here about this the other day) as an officer, as an intellectual, and as a general.  If Gen Petreaus gets Sec of State - I will be **very** impressed.  As a born and raised US Citizen who's parents immigrated here legally over 30 years ago and became proud citizens, who disagrees  a metric fuckton with the President Elect, I will definitely be proud of both choices. I don't want to jinx it with a robot like Romney.. the guy has 0 foreign policy experience - whereas General Petreaus is respected by and personally has working relationships with more world leaders and military brass then Romney can possibly name.To put it simply, when Secretary of State Petreaus calls the Prime Minister/President/King/Chancellor/Dictator of another country - they're going to answer. When Secretary of State Romney calls, he'll probably be put on hold and then asked to leave a message.
Oh fuck the hell yes. Mattis eats fear and shits victory. He's the guy that Ares, the Olympian god of war, writes fan-fiction about. He's what happens when General George S Patton gets bitten by a radioactive Erwin Rommel and gains all of his amazing powers. He's worthy to wield Mjolnir, but he'd never trust a weapon given to him by a foreign national and besides, he's just so used to his Kabar.  If you fuck with America in your dreams, he wakes you up by pressing the barrel of a gun to your head and gives you a stern talking-to. For the first offense.   Seriously, the man is a legend in his own time and became such within the Marine Corps, a group of people who are not easy to impress. This is Trump's best appointment yet, and I generally like the others. 
This patriot was part of an intelligence test operation. There were two teams Red (Mad Dog was the leader of them) and Blue. It was meant to emulate a war situation where the Red had the normal intel and Blue had literally every intel advantage possible. Sattelites, advanced SONAR, you name it. They wanted to test whether it was better to have super advanced intel that took a long time to analyze or a small amount of intel with a fast and efficent decision making process. Anyway, they get to a crucial battle with Red defending the mainland from Blue ships. After days of analyzing intel, the Blue sends half their fleet in to attack. As this is happening, the Blue generals are pouring over data. Mad Dog fires all his missles and sinks half their fleet. The next day, they replace Mad Dog with some other general who had a list of rules he had to follow. Seriously. Bit of an oversimplication, but this post would be way to long.  Tl;dr Mad Dog is good with missles.
SHHHHHHH He said to keep it between us!

Breaking news: Trump doesn't understand how television works, accidentally leaks top Cabinet pick.
This is the best Cabinet news since Bannon. I haven't liked every pick but I love this one. 
#YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO TELL ANYONE
#THE PENTAGON HAS FIVE SHARP POINTS.   JUST LIKE MATTIS'S KNIFE HAND  #\#NOTACOINCIDENCE 
As a Marine, this is the best day since the election day for me. 
Another great pick, his cabinet is going to be super stacked (already is)
"You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil. You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them. Actually, it's a lot of fun to fight. You know, it's a hell of a hoot. It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right upfront with you, I like brawling."  Fuck yeah.
I had a dream where I was a jarhead asleep at desk for 10 minutes. Mad Dog came in and personally executed me for dereliction of duty. Now I wonder what terrifying nightmares will ISIS/Daesh have. 
This man is going to hunt down those fuckers in the Middle-East and I wouldn't be surprised if he was the one leading the charge literally over there!
Something tells me we are purging the PC and SJW culture that creeped into the armed forces.
"I come in peace. I didn’t bring artillery. But I’m pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you fuck with me, I’ll kill you all." James Mattis
I'm in the Corps and my Facebook feed lit up like a christmas tree within 5 minutes of the announcement. This train has no breaks and will need no breaks.   I've personally met and shook Mattis' hand. He is a living legend amongst the Corps and soon to be amongst the American people. He won't put troops in harms way and he's going to be direct with both Trump and the nation. No more of this PC safe space military. I'm looking forward to the military's future with someone who understands the purpose of the military is killing and not looking like a social movement. 
# EVEN IN THIS PICTURE HE'S FORMULATING A BATTLE PLAN # BASED GENERAL
Obama fired him and Trump gives him a promotion. What a time to be alive. I'll never tire of winning. 
SO MUCH WINNING FUUUUUCKKKK
I've never been so damn excited for a president in my life.
"If in order to kill the enemy you have to kill an innocent, don't take the shot. Don't create more enemies than you take out by some immoral act."   I like this one. 
MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG! MAD DOG!

Well, looks like I may be going back into the corps. I almost feel bad for ISIS, the fist fucking they are about to endure is going to be brutal. Semper fi!
DOWNVOTE THIS STICKY! DON'T LET ANYONE KNOW!
WHOOO LET THE DOG OUT? 
After the media got all hysterical about his fun to shoot people quote I never thought I would see the day that this legendary devil dog would become the Secretary if Defense. I always thought it would take some truly troubling times for a man like him to finally be seen in a positive light. All it took was a true leader being elected President for people to see the light. This is monumental for Marines such as myself. I'm so happy our military can finally be brought back to its former glory under some true leadership and intelligence. Semper fucking Fi mad dog Mattis.
Hi everyone! This is my first post on The_Donald, though I've been lurking for months. This place gave me hope when I'd get depressed about the possibility of a Hitlery win, so thanks for that!   I was laughing so damned hard while listening to President-Elect Trump's speech tonight, that I was in tears. And I freaking LOVE that he picked Mad Dog. How can anyone not love a man who flat out says that some assholes just need to be shot??   Anyway, I suck at making memes, but I made this one to honor our next Secretary of Defense:   http://i.imgur.com/7EB9EEn.jpg   
God damn. This guy makes me super patriotic and I'm not even American.  Why is there so few people in the world like this guy? Why are there so many of the cancerous SJWs who think the exact opposite of him? Can't people see that he speaks common sense?  That being said, this now sends a message to ISIS: BYE FELICIA
#DO NOT UPVOTE STICKY THREADS  
Trump:"Bring me the most badass general."
OMG trump did not hire an unqualified transgender black woman? I guess Trump is literally HITLER!!! 
Our Secretary of Defenses name is MAD DOG  God damnit I love this country
Soon we will learn from CNN that Mattis eats babies and lynches people in his backyard.
#[ISIS right now](http://i.imgur.com/fza2zLr.gif)
“I come in peace. I didn’t bring artillery. But I’m pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you fuck with me, I’ll kill you all.”  After the initial invasion of Iraq, Mattis met with Iraqi military officers in 2003 and delivered these cautionary words — his own take on “big stick policy.”  FUCKING LEGEND MADDOG
Holy Fuck, I've never been so excited to be in the Army.   #MAKE THE ARMED FORCES GREAT AGAIN, BABY
It'll be a wonder to behold. He'll devise the most brutally efficient doom for ISIS. No standing armies. No massive targets. Just waves of relentless spec ops. Thousands of the worlds finest super soldiers will descend upon the caliph. Seals will pour from the night as nightmares and the terrorist will truly know terror. It will be so brutal that no extremist will ever raise a caliph of terror again. We will rein in a new age of peace with what we're about to do to ISIS. Lessons will be learned. Examples will be made of. Ideals will be decimated. It will be a thing of beauty and we have front row seats.

Let's keep this secret on our subreddit.  Can't trust the dishonest media
MADDOG'S KNIFEHAND IS GONNA CLEANUP THE PENTAGON! SQUARING AWAY LIKE YOUR PVT ASS HAS NEVER SEEN!
DoD got its balls back.
General Mattis once body checked an artillery shell. 
Pede's with this one pick, every single shit bag in the World just slammed a plate out of his mother's hand and is literally shaking right now! They can't even right now!!!
[deleted]
Mad Dog is the best appointment Trump could have possibly made - ISIS is toast. 
All I can say is that I'm glad he's on our side. Holy shit this man is bad ass.
Trump appointed this fucking Jarhead as Secretary of Defense? I'm so hard right now...Fuck Yeah! God Bless You, President Trump. And God Bless the United States of America.  P.S. ISIS, you're fucked. 
One bad ass mother fucker.      Trump is not fucking around.
After reading through this thread, all I can say is: Holy fuck, this guy is Patton reincarnated and I love it.
No more sending leaflets to ISIS warning them of drone/bomb strikes!! Bye bye!!
GUYS. YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO LEAK THIS.  THE DAHNALD IS LEAKING!  SPEZ WAS RIGHT?!?!?
The United States Marine Corps is officially going to lose their shit‼️
I fist pumped.
Interesting. For everyone saying "ISIS is fucked now", ISIS would be fucked the minute the US government and US sidekicks like Turkey stopped supporting, funding, arming and coordinating ISIS. ISIS is and always was a fake opponent, created as a Neocon/Globalist PR exercise after 'Al Qaeda' wore out as a boogyman.  Also, *despite* US support for ISIS, Russia has been doing a great job of scrubbing them out, and could be just left to it. Since, you know, Russia actually has legal permission to be in Syria and the US/NATO doesn't.  The REAL significance of Trump appointing a very popular direct-acting general like Mattis, is how the military will react if Trump has the election stolen out from under him by Democrat recount and delegate cheating.  Hillary, Sorros, take note. *You* are the enemies of Freedom, not your hand puppet ISIS. Mattis seems like a guy who won't fart around dealing with intermediaries.
"I don't lose any sleep at night over the potential for failure. I cannot even spell the word"  "Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everyone you meet."  -- General James Mattis    I think we'll be alright.   Spez: to add that he's a true patriot in every sense of the fucking word.  Get the man a coat damnit. 
Picture all the scenes in Fury Road where the warboyz are losing their shit over Immortan Joe.  That's about the closest representation I've seen to the love the Marines have for General Mattis.    If he gave me a rusty hammer, a firm handshake and said 'Semper Gumby, devil' I could take Beijing.  
Dear, Sweet, General Mattis,  I wish you had been my commander in the early days of the Iraq war.  If this administration fixes our abysmal foreign policy and delivers on its promises, you may see me back in line at MEPS for a second go round...   
"You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a viel. You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's shell of a lot of fun to shoot them. Actually quite fun to fight them, you know. It's a hell of a hoot. It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up there with you. I like brawling."   - James " Mad Dog" Mattis         Forget about secretary of defense. We have a secretary of offense. 
Flint, Michigan: Lets use our high energy to get them clean water. If for nothing more, to fry the brains of the Never-Trumps.
Fix the water problem because it is the right and smart thing to do
If Trump fixes this problem it will send a huge message to communities all over the US!
All Americans deserve clean water, it's a fucking disgrace.
Alex Jones for Secretary of Water Filtration 
[deleted]
Announce you'll include Flint MI in the infrastructure plan
The water problem persists because they fucked their pipes by pumping polluted shit through it, they don't just need a new aquifer but likely a majority of all the city's water pipes need to be replaced. This is a massive problem and really calls for the federal government to step in.  Why in fuck's name do we send a couple b2's halfway around the world to drop one tenth their max load is fucking beyond me when we have people at home suffering as the result of the inadequate diligence paid them by their elected officials.
I wish this was our most upvoted post ever. Get them clean water President Trump! American citizens do not have proper drinking water !!! 
As a Michigan pede I would double appreciate any meme magic you lads can pull off! Thanks for still remembering MI after MSM stopped talking about it
Left leaning cuck here, but I must admit the power of this subreddit is so impressive. I hope you guys succeed.
Make Water Clean Again
Just give Alex jones a giant, nationwide contract for providing water filters.
We should really meme the Flint water problem, if we get enough weponzied autism we could actually do something...
Trump team: You want an inner city win? You want 12 years in the white house? Start the infrastructure plan now in Flint. Just start. Day one of week two. Just send the crews or hire local.  I authorize all of my taxes ever collected to start this. For all future taxes I will need to see phase two of the plan. Checked in triplicate and sent to the budgeting office.
So when I first heard about the water problem in Flint, I didn't believe it. How can it be THAT bad, is it really such a problem?  I literally shower and make my coffee with water that comes from poo I made days previous. Where Obama is now, Rancho Mirage CA, the Coachella Valley Water District just sent a letter out saying Hexavalent Chromium has been detected in the water.   But we use technology, new methods to combat this; most people in LA and Orange county shower and drink reclaimed water, its a fact.  Thats why I couldn't believe it, because I come from an area with huge water problems; but its solvable, its curable - Its 2017 and we can do it.  It wasn't until recently that I started connecting with people from Flint and its SO BAD there, SO BAD. So SAD, we can solve the problem; we have the technology and capability as a nation to do this, why are we not executing a plan to clean it up?  If if if if if we do not solve this problem, then people will eventually start to die, if Flint dies out, more people will die there then those who lost their lives during Operation Iraqi Freedom - but why does it need to be more dangerous to live in Flint then to get shot at during a war? Crazy.   Lets MAGA just for the sake of doing what is right for our fellow citizens.  
As an anti-trumper, do more of this and I will keep handing you likes and upvotes. Great to see this post!
This would keep Michigan RED for a very long time
[Reminder that a business was fixing the pipes and the local government stopped them](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/03/04/state-halts-start-flint-pipe-replacement/81303990/). 
My first The_Donald upvote. I'll wager there are more issues we can find common ground on, too.
Soros could have put that 90 million dollars to good use.  Instead, he funded a women's March that left a bad taste in our mouths.  Everyone deserves equal clean water. ##waterqualityequality
First post in this sub I've ever upvoted.  Fingers crossed that I see some more good ideas float up in /r/all in the coming weeks.
Why are all the comments at 0?  Who the fuck is so butthurt that they don't want clean water for America?  Good Lord people...get a grip.
He really needs to do this. Make his a priority and send a message to everyone that no one is left behind! 
I don't give a shit about the optics or politics behind this.  It's a basic service and public health issue, and I'm embarrassed that in this great country we have a city with undrinkable water.  This would be a great place to start Making America Great Again.
we were talking tonight about exactly this...it's needed and would be a brilliant thing to do. Amazed when i saw your post! This needs to happen!
Fucking do it, you glorious bastards. I, and likely most of the other Bernie supporters, will be right fucking behind you. Just don't stop there. There's thousands of communities in the US unknowingly living with huge environmental health risks. 
Why didn't Michael Moore fix it? I mean it is his hometown. He has a ton of money and is always bitching.

Imagine how michael moore would feel if Trump made Flint Michigan a wealthy city again. He made his career on the back of this city.
Posts like this is what will bring us together, keep it up guys! This is the only way.

I WANT TO SEE MICHIGAN BE FUCKING GREAT AGAIN!!!! WE CAN DO THIS.
I'm all for this! Michelle Moore autistic screeching, anyone?
#flintwatercrisis  I tweeted @realdonaldtrump, match me!
Good job guys. Thank you. There are a lot of people revolving around the Trump name. I don't agree with much of what they say, but I know that there are good people on both sides.   Keep trying to do good. And do what you can to stop your "side" from instigating. Stop trying to be right, and just do good. 
I voted Hillary, I wanted Bernie, I got Trump. I'm not a #notmypresident guy because I'm an American, but I'll be damn proud to call him President if he gets this done.
What will the libs do when trump finally brings flint water?   Trump: let's get clear water in flint!  CNN: climate change denier Donald trump tries to disrupt the water cycle 
The fact that an American city has undrinkable water is a major stain on our reputation.  Its pathetic. Its unacceptable. It needs to be fixed ASAP.
[deleted]
And when he is done with that can we save the Great Lakes and root out the impending carp problem?
Is there actually a proposal on how to fix this problem? Who is actually responsible for fixing this? Shouldn't it be a local or state problem?  I would imagine that if the state/local government wasn't/couldn't do anything, this would be a situation where the EPA or some other federal agency would step in and fix it.   Thanks Obama. 
Lets get it done, centipedes!
You know I bet I could get some damn affordable housing by moving to Flint... I think I just might if I could find work in the area. Already need to filter my water here.
Make Water Great Again
84%?  Who would downvote this...
Great idea - how can we help?
Nice picture of Flint and all but how exactly do we use our energy to help them..I actually would like to help
I hate to say it but this is a fucking stupid attitude. He shouldn't fix it to show the never trumps he can do great things. He should fix it because it needs to be fixed and has needed to be fixed for 3 years 
I love how it is 68% upvoted. Gotta love people.

Lead is terrible on the brains of young children. When it was removed from the gasoline violent crime went down almost exactly one generation later. I would hate to live in Flint ten years from now. All Americans should have access to clean drinking water. It's not just a social issue. It's long-term crime prevention.

**NOW THIS IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION.**  **MEME IT INTO EXISTENCE, 'PEDES.**
Fix it, boast about it, and remind everyone that it was done during this presidency. If I were in a dire need of water I wouldn't give two shits about what is said as long as the problem gets resolved 
This is awesome! Normally not with this domreddit in terms of ideas, but this is something we should pitch into. 
TAKE MY ENERGY \0/ !!!!
[deleted]
We need to help the Flint people. Lead water can cause serious problems and we should have quality water.. we ain't some country in Africa.
Maybe I'm in the minority, but as someone who did not support President Trump, I don't know why him doing something to provide those people with clean water would do anything but make me happy.   Maybe I'm doing my liberalism wrong or something. 
A positive and helpful thing from the Donald wow nice.
If you can't fix the water problem in Flint. What's to come for the rest of the crumbling infrastructure?
What do we need to do to get things moving?
This is disgusting and inhumane, fix the FUCKING water problem or condemn the whole place.
So, it's the Right that wants "dirty air and dirty water"? Why do we need the EPA if they can't even keep shit like this from languishing? These poor people.
Sort out a plan and I will donate or make memes or sue someone.
1. I would start with clean water spickets in centralized areas as a stop gap.  This will allow the families to get immediate help.  2. Work with the local leadership to plan gradual replacement of all less-urgent piping.  If you rush it, it will cost a fortune, and the locals aren't rich.    They need leadership, not a hand out.
You know what? If he actually does something about this, more power to him. I doubt it, but I sincerely hope I'm proven wrong.
Now this is a cause I can get behind! But what is the actual problem now that we're trying to solve? It seems like they're getting under control and working on the solution.  From the wiki: > On September 27, 2016, Flint officials announced the city will stay on Detroit water until at least October 2017 to give it time to construct a newly required stretch of pipeline and allow for testing of water Flint will treat from the KWA.[47]  > On December 9, 2016 the MDEQ reported more than 96 percent of water samples tested at high-risk Flint homes in November 2016 were below the federal lead threshold of 15 parts per billion.[48] 
If trump can fix the water problem in flint, and lower crime in the state, he'll prove to many that he's a capable president able to do what Obama couldn't.
Where is our based filtration system guy Alex? we need you bro
Don't corrupt such a good message. NO matter what side you are on, these good people deserve better from their government and compassion from other people.

What can I, a humble pede, do to help Flint? Let me know, please.

"Flint Mayor Karen Weaver has pledged to dig up and replace the city’s almost 30,000 lead service lines, but so far only about 700 have been replaced. Weaver blames the slow pace on inclement weather and a lack of state funding. At the town hall last week, officials said it could take up to three years for a complete overhaul.  **The city has received $27 million from the state for the project, money Weaver describes as “enough to get us started” but not enough to finish.** In a smaller sign of progress, last Friday the state announced that up to 4,000 Flint homes could receive new faucets to replace brass ones that could potentially contribute to lead contamination in the water.  **“It’s a shame it’s taken this long,” Weaver says. “We need and deserve new pipes.”**  http://time.com/4634937/flint-water-crisis-criminal-charges-bottled-water/?xid=time_socialflow_twitter  - #...meanwhile:  "US sent $221 million to Palestinians in Obama's last hours  WASHINGTON (AP) — **Officials say the Obama administration in its waning hours defied Republican opposition and quietly released $221 million to the Palestinian Authority that GOP members of Congress had been blocking."**  **"The Palestinian funding is likely to draw anger from some in Congress as well as the Trump White House.** Trump has vowed to be a strong supporter of Israel and has invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit Washington next month."  https://apnews.com/b8446cbf5b504b1abaf49eb0d646367b/US-sent-$221-million-to-Palestinians-in-Obama's-last-hours
Guys...funding is determined by the Congress not Obama. He should have put pressure on all of them but you could have too by picking up the phone.  And if you've been paying attention, there's 100+ million dollars that has been approved to fix the water infrastructure in flint as of december. Hopefully there will be some progress there now.  
Trump actually spoke alot about Flint. Maybe thats the big win of the day?
My first and current car was built in this town's Buick City (R.I.P.).
It was a HUGE topic in the DNC debates, but then it got blown off. If Trump fixes their water, I am 99% sure Liberal heads will spin and go "POISON THEIR WATER, FUCK FLINT MICHIGAN!"
CNN's about to be in trouble. Bigly.

CNN is Very Fake News
Holy shit, CNN is fake news confirmed by their own employee!!!! I can't stop fucking laughing, we've been winning all day and its still only Monday. 
#Monday, June 26, 2017. MARK IT DOWN!  This is the winningest day since November 8, 2016.
James O'Keefe delivers the goods again!  The libtard cucks will, as usual, demand the 'full and unedited' video footage to be shown, otherwise it's all 'fabrications from Alt-Right trolls'.  Wait for it.
Holy shit. This is amazing. All praise Pimp O'keefe 
Attention liberals! CNN doesn't just think you're stupid and easily fooled- they bank on it.
Whenever liberal morons talk about "fake news" sarcastically or the Russia nonsense, just link them this.  This is huge, this will be all over Fox tomorrow. Probably force a couple resignations from CNN.  EDIT: So here's what I think happened.    * O'Keefe and his crew penetrated CNN.   * They recorded a bunch of hidden camera videos just like this.   * On their way out they planted the fake Russia story from last week to show how stupid CNN is.   * This forced the three resignations from CNN today.   Hopefully more to follow. 
CNN will be claiming themselves, that they're Fake News as a defense soon. 
#HOLY MOTHER OF FUCK!  I was wondering when we'd get something like this. O'Keefe was hinting at it on Hannity's radio show recently.
#You saw it here first folks. How long until Drudge picks it up and the MSM ignores it? Don't let them act like this isn't yuge! CNN is going down!

so the CEO of CNN directs his "journalists" to drop stories and exclusively report on russia in order to keep ratings high, and this CNN producer knows that its horseshit.  Fake News.

John Bonifield is not one of the people fired by CNN over the retracted  Russia story on Friday. I think there may be a 2nd part of this expose regarding a fake planted story as well, we'll see...
Where was this released.... Is this the preview from the video tomorrow?
This has been the greatest week ever.... and it's Monday!!!
Share this everywhere!   muh Russia blown da fuck up!
This better be on reddit's front page for weeks.
Sue them for libel. How much more proof do you Need? Strip their white house press credentials. Enough is enough. Fuck CNN!
I couldn't even watch the whole thing. I'm fucking enraged. These pieces of shit, cultural Marxists, are carrying out the KGB's long term plan to destroy America from within, and they don't even realize it. And at the same time they point the finger at the other side and accuse them. Degenerate, leftist vermin. You expect a guy like this to be a stand up guy, but he's so unprofessional, I wouldn't even accept his attitude if he was my employee at Jamba juice.
This is it. I'm tired of winning. I need to put the phone down and get something done with my day, *but we just keep winning* . I'm tired Mr president :(
Fuck yeah get on this shit Hannity!
Money is more important than ethics. Right from the horses mouth, folks.

The merger would kill competition and would hurt consumers by increasing prices, and would lower wages for employees etc.  This is why anti trust laws were created and such laws should be enforced against the merger so fake news does not profit from creating a monopoly

@realDonaldTrump: If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?
HE ACTUALLY ADDRESSED IT!  I LOVE IT!
In 2017, I can rely on my President to defend my right to free speech even from politically correct "universities" - and it feels so good to say that. 
[Donald Trump threatens to withdraw federal funds from Berkeley University after Breitbart editor talk cancelled](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-breitbart-news-remove-federal-funding-berkeley-university-california-milo-yiannopoulos-a7558946.html)  Are you fucking kidding with that headline...  Yeah, it's totally about the talk being canceled and not about Berkley allowing violence and riots. Yup, totally. This is some fake news bullshit.
As a german i am so fucking jealous that Trump is your president folks!
I'm living in another country, but this libshit actions so infuriating that even siting at work in the middle of Russia I barelly contain rage. I'm glad that Trump knows how to handle this type of bullshit. I wish you well.
So apparently the argument is now that Trump is suppressing free speech by threatening to cut funding to education...  How's that for some legendary level shitbaggery?  I bet these liberal types see a cape flowing behind themselves in the breeze every time they look in a mirror.  O.o

LITERALLY /O U R G U Y /
MSM seems confused at the difference between a peaceful protest (see: Life March) and a riot. We need to call this out for what it is, rioting, and perhaps domestic terrorism.  Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of this country, rioting is not. Intimidation is not. Preventing students from hearing Milo - and perhaps entertaining a different viewpoint - goes against the very ideals of education.  We shouldn't be paying for, or tolerating this.  Lessee how they do without those sweet, sweet taxpayer dollars.
I agree. No federal funds!
Thank you Mr President. 
I love this guy more and more each day. 
Holy shit.  Amazing.  Fucking hell yes.  Fuck universities getting federal funding if they will only apply free speech to one side.   #heswithus

lol at the Independent and r/redacted screaming about him threatening to pulls funds because a breitbart editor couldn't speak.   No, it's because people were literally being beaten near to death in the streets and the school did nothing about it. 
Not to mention that their Undocumented Students program effectively pays for illegals' education with tax payer dollars. They should get the same treatment as sanctuary cities, regardless of this incident.  
I could see him doing this, but I could also see the Left fund-raise and donate to counter it.  I don't see them doing it for the next decade. I also don't see them doing it if other schools decide to follow Berkeley's cowardly path and find themselves in the same bind.

A private college should not be getting federal funds.   Also illegals / non-US citizens should not be in our colleges where our red blooded American youth should be.  This is about America.
Dammit - my finger is getting tired upvoting these threads. This is the best news-wave of posts I've seen since election day. It's like minecraft. At this rate my mousebutton is going to melt.  
LOL CUCKS ARE DOWNVOTING   YOU DONT WANT FREE SPEECH ON CAMPUSES  YOU DONT WANT FREE SPEECH ON THE STREETS  YOU DONT WANT FREE SPEECH ON THE INTERNET   YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE YOU ARE FASCISTS 
IIRC, Department of Education have oversight on university accreditation bodies. I'm sure some knife twisting is possible from that end to fuck up some of these school's accreditations. 
Don't forget to remove funding from Berkely who couldn't be bothered to control the situation. Rescind the student loans too. Now we can start to put Honeland security on BLM and Antifa as well as investigate Soros.  You thought that was the smart play REEEEEEEEEtards? Think again.
Donald has some brass balls and I love it.
Obama would have found a way to blame everyone but the violent shitheads.
It feels like the USA has a president once more instead of a worthless puppet.
Wow, he is actually forcing them to get their adult-children under control! Fucking great news!  Fuck these violently tolerant libfags too
"Antifa" should be declared a terrorist organization and their members should be imprisoned. 
I literally cannot handle looking at the twitter comments. Anyone else? Seriously. EVERY single one ignores the violence at Berkeley saying how can you hate this peaceful protest? And saying oh no we need to deport you president! Lmaoooo. Is the population really this stupid? Seriously. It's all emojis as an arguement holy fuck
**DADDY LOVES MILO**
I know this goes against the narrative here but I'll post anyway:  I just wanted to say I'm a Berkeley Alum and while I didn't agree with the protests to begin with as I'm a Centpiede too, and I was outraged that they shut Milo down, I decided to go over there and see what was going on.  I witnessed first hand what Antifa was doing (beating people, destroying property, burning stuff, shooting fireworks at cops). These guys are literally the devil. They were going around beating people with their metal sticks, and would then hide back in the crowd. When I tried to take a photo of them holding a sign, I was shoved aside and told NO PHOTOS. These guys are cowards and afraid to even show their faces.  There were two different groups of people I witnessed:  1. The Cal students/Berkeley hippies/locals. They were carrying the typical protest signs. They were chanting. They were playing music on instruments and dancing. No violence, no attacking, but they definitely were not happy with our President. While I don't agree with these guys' viewpoint, remember the addage "A conservative will fight for a liberal's right to free speech on campus while a liberal will fight so a conservative can't speak on campus?"  2. Around the corner there was Antifa with their signs. They were blasting "FUCK THE POLICE" music while their people ran around beating people and destroying property hiding behind the crowd. I'm not even sure if they care about President Trump, but are more interested in just destroying the city.  So look, at the end of the day, my outrage of the Milo event being shutdown turned into outrage against this terrorist organization. They were the ones at the front lines [destroying campus property](https://i.imgur.com/tcBQZNB.jpg). They were the ones breaking into Starbucks, stealing cups and coffee. They were the ones who [smashed ATMs](https://twitter.com/JxhnBinder/status/827007066615197696), [broke into banks](https://twitter.com/Zanting/status/827023486895931393), [beat people up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BZvhYkB4xo), etc.   NO AMERICAN should EVER have to tolerate this kind of terrorism. MAGA!  And like I said, while I'm not happy with the protests, there were definitely two distinct groups. You can disregard my observations if you wish.  Cutting federal funding I think would be the wrong approach. Instead I think we should go after terrorist groups like Antifa. They were the ones disrupting the Inauguration with violent protests as well. They've showed up at a lot of other protests around the country and were the ones responsible for the shooting at UW campus when Milo was scheduled to speak too.
I don't mind Berkeley losing federal funding since they basically have said they'll defy federal orders, but they did denounce what happened tonight and recognized it as a violation of free speech. I think the rioters were mostly the crazy "antifa" terrorists.  Berkeley's statement:  >We condemn in the strongest possible terms the violence and unlawful behavior that was on display, and deeply regret that those tactics will now overshadow the efforts to engage in legitimate and lawful protest against the performer’s presence and perspectives.  >The University and the UCPD went to extraordinary lengths to plan for this event and put the appropriate resources in place in order to maintain security. Officials were in contact with other campuses and paid close attention to lessons learned at the speaker’s prior events. Dozens of additional police officers were on duty. Multiple methods of crowd control were in place. Ultimately and unfortunately, however, it was simply impossible to maintain order given the level of threat, disruption, and violence.  >We regret that the threats and unlawful actions of a few have interfered with the exercise of First Amendment rights on a campus that is proud of its history and legacy as home of the Free Speech Movement. As Chancellor Dirks made clear in his message to the Berkeley campus community, while Mr. Yiannopoulos views, tactics and rhetoric are profoundly contrary to our own, we are bound by the Constitution, the law, our values, and the campus’s Principles of Community to enable free expression across the full spectrum of opinion and perspective.  EDIT: but they didn't even make any arrests so their was some serious incompetence there. I still think they support free speech more than many other campus administrations, though. The violence was obviously not endorsed by the campus itself unless you count failing to make arrests/keep it safe as endorsing

Forgive my ignorance here but what does any college need with federal funds these days?  College is insanely expensive.  A quick Gooogle search found that average tuition is $25K a year at UC Berkley.  They have over 38,000 students so that equals a rough $950 million a year.    Wtf do they need additional money for????
As a Californian, President Trump, please consider future proofing your plan and just revoke all federal funding from the entire damn state.
U. C. Berkley just made themselves look like the dumbest fools in the world. Not only will those students realize how wrong they were about Trump when they're up to speed, they've also marked a permanent stain on the school's reputation that will make it a laughing stock, a symbol of the brainwashed epidemic, that will place the school  in the history books as a cuck factory. 
Reddit just purged this from the front page.
Look at this cuck   @realDonaldTrump The Quebec City terrorist was white, a supporter of yours, and killed six Muslim men. Yet you attack Islam. Despicable!  Literally had nothing to do with it and he has to bring up how "innocent muslims" are being attacked. Professional victims people
and so it begins. The downfall of PC culture.  First they ignore you then they mock you then they fight you then you win. The mockery part happened last year. Now, they are fighting.
Remember when Starbucks pledged to hire 10,000 refugees.   Well the rioters looted that place last night
what's sad is that the left that has been running the colleges for years wants to act like they are the resistance and not the establishment that they really are.
I cannot believe it. Trump is like... like a wish, like a dream that became true. 8 years of Trump please. MAGA, MEGA.

American College of Pediatrics reaches decision: Transgenderism of children is child abuse
Someone better notify Angelina Jolie. Claims Shiloh was transgender at age of 2. http://www.ibtimes.com/shiloh-jolie-pitt-transgender-rumors-2016-what-angelina-brad-said-about-their-2419943
You damn straight its child abuse! I mean okay...if you wanna go transgender I really don't care. But once you make that final choice, they're are no do-overs. And you should be a legal adult to make that decision, not having your parents decide it for you and push you into it just because its trendy.
A lot of these parents I suspect are either activists that use their children as pawns to push their agenda, or very naive people with sympathies towards transgenderism.  If they see any traits that match transgenders they just assume that's what they are even though many of those traits aren't abnormal in children for short periods of time.

    1. Human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait: “XY” and “XX” are genetic markers of health – not genetic markers of a disorder.      2. No one is born with a gender. Everyone is born with a biological sex. Gender (an awareness and sense of oneself as male or female) is a sociological and psychological concept; not an objective biological one.      3. A person’s belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking. When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such.      4. Puberty is not a disease and puberty-blocking hormones can be dangerous. Reversible or not, puberty-blocking hormones induce a state of disease – the absence of puberty – and inhibit growth and fertility in a previously biologically healthy child.      5. According to the DSM-V, as many as 98% of gender confused boys and 88% of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty.      6. Children who use puberty blockers to impersonate the opposite sex will require cross-sex hormones in late adolescence. Cross-sex hormones (testosterone and estrogen) are associated with dangerous health risks including but not limited to high blood pressure, blood clots, stroke and cancer.      7. Rates of suicide are twenty times greater among adults who use cross-sex hormones and undergo sex reassignment surgery, even in Sweden which is among the most LGBQT – affirming countries.      8. Conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful as child abuse.  **Thank God for normal people that still exist.**

They wrote an open letter to the DOE & DOJ in June 2016 as well:  > *A Medical Response to DOE & DOJ Guidance for Schools:*  > Affirmation of gender dysphoria has no basis in science and is highly controversial among experts. Gender dysphoria (GD) describes the mental condition in which an individual experiences discordance between  his gender identity and his biological sex.  > 1. Experts agree that 80-95% of pre-pubertal youth with gender  dysphoria will come to accept their biological sex by late adolescence.  > 2. Consequently, affirmation of pre-pubertal children in their belief that they are the opposite sex is considered by many to be cooperating with a child's mental confusion and to be shepherding him  along the path to a mental disorder.   Edit: and they conclude:  > Schools should encourage an environment of respectful self-expression for all students. Parental involvement  should be a school’s primary method of resolution for particular cases with programs emphasizing general  respectfulness serving to set the tone in the classrooms. It is both in keeping with this spirit of respectfulness  and imperative for the optimal health of all students, to avoid all curricula, books and other media, and policies,  that promote and normalize the scientifically baseless gender fluid ideology. **This includes maintaining  restrooms and other private spaces that are assigned according to biological sex.**   https://www.acpeds.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/9.5.16-A-Medical-Response-to-Obamas-guidance-to-schools-4.pdf

This is wonderful news. This is one of the 3 SJW causes I care about. Everyone who has ever been a parent knows that children are incapable of making such a decision. They have no idea who they are or what they want. My son swears he is a rhino one day, a dog another, a fireman another and yesterday he told me he was only eating watermelon for the rest of his life. In the moment, they mean it, but he wont even remember meaning it in a day or two. Children are not sexual beings and have no business focusing on "gender identity" they have little to no concept of "self" for a very long time. If I had any idea about computers or video editing I would make a whole Youtube channel dedicated to children transitioning, abortion, and patronization of minorities and women. This is a win! Im so happy!!!!!

No shit. 
This is a big fucking deal.
It is okay for boys to feel and act 'feminine' as we have termed it.  It is okay for girls to feel and act 'masculine' as we have termed it.  Girls cut their hair short and wear men's clothes all the time. Doesn't mean they need to go on hormone replacement.  Boys should feel more free to grow out their hair or wear dresses. Doesn't mean they need to cut their dick off.

It's distressing how this is somehow news to some people and controversial.  Got to keep pulling that Overton Window back to a place where human dignity is expected in and from everyone again.
I mean just to be clear American College of Pediatricians isn't by any means a force of powerful change in america. They're a fringe group of 500 members that broke off from the larger American Academy of Pediatricians, which has 600,000 members, because the AAoP said it was okay for gay people to adopt and 500 pediatricians didn't agree with that. 
will a transgender pede offer their thoughts or experiences with this? 
A quick look at Wikipedia also shows that they oppose adoption by same sex couples, and support abstinence until marriage sex education. Also some pretty significant criticism.   >Some scientists have voiced concerns that ACPeds mischaracterized or misused their work to advance its political agenda.[2][16] Gary Remafedi, a pediatrician at the University of Minnesota, wrote ACPeds a public letter accusing them of fundamentally mischaracterizing his research in their publications to argue that schools should deny support to gay teenagers. Francis Collins, a geneticist and director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), issued a statement through the NIH accusing the ACPeds of misleading children and parents on its Facts About Youth website.[16] Warren Throckmorton, a therapist who specializes in sexual orientation issues, similarly stated that his research had been misused, saying of ACPeds: "They say they're impartial and not motivated by political or religious concerns, but if you look at who they're affiliated with and how they're using the research, that's just obviously not true."[2]
I've been saying this for a while now. With only 0.3% of the population being trans... Why is the news, media, and government so preoccupied with all the trans issues.   It's because it's a distraction
"A person’s belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking."  AKA, mental illness.

yes of course it is...but the left is about to lose whatever remains of their collective minds
As a child, I loved to play in the mud, race hot wheels, play Star Trek, and all the things that classifies one as a 'Tomboy'.   I hated dresses, my hair done any other way than pulled into a ponytail. I wore jeans and a tee, chuck t's, and usually at least 4 layers of dirt, gravel and filth. My best friends were Robby and Wes, and never once did I ever consider that I could be anything other than a girl that like boy stuff. All that changed when I was about 14, and I just started seeing boys differently. I still have more male friends than female, but I'm not in any way feeling misidentified in my sexuality.  But growing up the same way today? I'd be sporting as penis with testosterone injections. It's mystifying to me that, as a society, we've decided that this type of behavior is something that should be explained and justified by anything other than a girl that hates dolls.
Thank god there's still common sense in this country. There's still hope yet.
Thank god. How many statistics, studies/research and facts do parents need before they decide to not abuse a confused child? How many confused children need to suffer before their overbearing, "progressive" parents decide to listen to the facts and help them obtain a healthy normality? I feel for those kids, I really do.
Johns Hopkins is about as good as it gets in the medical world. They truly are the best of the best.   Based Johnny Hopkins will need to form a new trauma unit for all the liberal heads which are about to explode! 
I always said that
Think Progress described the American College of Pediatricians as a “hate group masquerading as pediatricians.”  The Huffington Post said that “Once again, Paul McHugh has used the ever more tarnished name of Johns Hopkins to distort science and spread transphobic misinformation.”  Science is transphobic.

Article is from March 2016. Just FYI, not that's it's been discredited or that they've changed their minds since then. It's just not breaking news. 
See what's horrible is that there's always a few steps that doctors use once the kid shows up to get them into starting hormones:  1) Show up at the doctor's for hormone therapy 2) doctor opens the door 3) child gets on the floor 4) everybody walk the dinosaur
One of my coworker's friends is a mother trying to raise their 6yo son as a girl - Parades him around in dresses, shops in girly stores, forces him to act like a girl, basically the whole 9 yards. CPS won't do anything because the mom says everything is fine and strongarms the boy into agreeing with her. You can tell he's miserable everywhere he goes, and he can't make friends with the girls in his class (for obvious reasons) while the boys avoid him because he's "weird". In reality he's totally normal and secretly loves Iron-man.  As far as I'm concerned, parents who subject their children to this should face HARD jail time. I'm happy with the ACP's decision; It should lead to better care for children abused by parents this way.
This triggers the leftist.
So while this is much needed, how soon until the massively politicized APA comes out against this, backed by the MSM and every anti-logic LGBT group out there who considers this hateful and "unscientific"?  Because, after all, science should be decided by committee, based on popular pressures from the loudest minority, and if nothing else, based on a twisted version of the data that has no basis in the facts. 
Crazy mommas who got boys but wanted a girl so they buy 'it' dresses and barbies. Or just a feminazi who hates men and wants a girl 
The American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) is a socially conservative advocacy group. The major professional association is The American Academy of Pediatrics.  So in other words, their opinion means nothing.
Thank you! I'm all for people making whatever decision will make them happiest in life, but pushing it on kids is sick. I got banned from lgbt for saying exactly this. Kids and teenagers for that matter aren't mature enough to make that decision, not to mention the nonstop romanticizing of mental disorders and obesity at a certain cult website that traps so many young people.
American College of Pediatricians is a bogus advocacy group promoting conservative views (stridently anti-abortion, anti-gay rights, etc). It is not a legitimate medical organization and is estimated to have under 500 members total.  The American Academy of Pediatrics, on the other hand, is a real medical group with 64,000 doctors as members and has no problem with transgenderism.

HA! Will love to see how Sally Cohn responds (she is the NPR reporter with abused 5 year old right?)

THANK YOU. FINALLY. 
Finally. Anybody who actually needed to be told that needs to seek help. Anybody who thinks the statement clarifies things for them, or even worse, disagrees with that statement, needs to seek help. If you fall into any of those categories  then please stay away from children.
I reject a 'sick' society where we have to pander to people's demands what to call them. I also reject a society where parent's have the right to reject biology and perform life altering procedures on a child because they have a lifestyle that seems to reflect one sex or the other. So that makes them 'transgender' -- I wore my brothers (male) clothes for 10 years growing up. I'm a woman. I'm ultra feminine, completely heterosexual and realize what I did was a phase or I was trying to gain more attention in someway. Regardless, classifying or raising someone as transgender is child abuse. And trying to normalize a mental illness that effects a tiny portion of the population is insane. 
Do what you want (speaking generally) *when you turn 18*.
"A person’s belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking."
Ill have you know I graduated high school with a 2.3 and attended a community college for feminist protest dance study. So let me tell you why the American College of Pediatrics is wrong.
Trump takes office and suddenly people start getting their common sense back. Thank god.  GO TRUMP!
Alt-left: "American college of paediatrics is literally Josef mengele"
the SPLC conveniently identifies the ACP as a hate group lmao.
This will trigger the F out of r/all if it ever made it there
I hate American College of Pediatrics now!!
"Facts – not ideology – determine reality"  *REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE*
I am dealing with this. My husband's ex swears their 7 year old daughter is trans.  I'm so pissed about it.  It's actually really sad.  I told her we are ready to go to court after 2 years (since she was 5) of this crap. 
Of course it is. If the kid isn't old enough to consent to sexual intercourse, then they aren't old enough to consent to progressive parents forcing hormone treatments on them for their sick agenda.  This is a god damn child abuse, and the poor children who are being coerced into these life changing decisions at such a young age will surely grow up to regret it or face serious mental damage. I can't believe this is even up for debate.

Well duh. MAGA  THANK GOD there are still sane doctors. 
Some cases are obvious but the forceful ones that cucks do to their children on purpose?  Sickening.
I usually wouldn't post here because im more of a socialist progressive type but fuck people that pump their kids full of hormones.   How is it acceptable to decide who your kid is attracted to before they can even get their dick hard? Some of these kids probably don't even know how to tie their shoes and you expect them to know how they want to live their life. Fuck that shit.
Yeah it's called the correct decision. You only need to check out r/TumblrinAction and periodically there's a post of some parent more or less indoctrinating their kid. It's fascinating...or would be, if it wasn't so sad.  I remember when the hate target of the USA was the Westboro Baptist Church for their blatant indoctrination of children, and how disgusting it was to see them march around some 7 year olds holding up signs that say "God hates fags" when they're too young to even know what any of that means or what a "fag" is. Fast forward to today, I have friends from high school on facebook proudly showing off their kid holding up a sign that says theirs more than two genders, or showing off that their little boy likes to wear skirts. I'm all for being supportive of a kid that's genuinely interested in girl stuff as a boy or vice versa, but when the *parent* is making it a point to brag about it, or giving them signs about gender to pose with in photos...? That's not about the kid, that's about the parent. That's the parent indocrinating the kid, whether they realize it/intend it or not.  Same concept here. I have 0 faith that a 12 year old that says he wants to be a girl has any idea what he's talking about. Let him go through the next 6 years, let him ***finish fucking puberty***, *then* if he hasn't changed his mind, *then* you can get the surgery. But when I've seen parents indoctrinating politics into their children, or bragging about how "progressive" their kid is...? No, I don't trust those dumbasses not to jump on the opportunity to give their kid a transgender operation; that isn't about the kid, that's about mommy feeling like she deserves attention and a trophy for being so progressive and understanding towards her kid, the problem being mommy doesn't GET a trophy if the kid is just a regular 'ole straight kid. Thus, yes, expect the narcissists to rush their children under the operating table too soon. The kid doesn't know better, the kid is not a reliable source. Give him 6 years and he will be. And while it'd be nice if parents were smart enough to know this, lord knows there's some dumb people out there, and that's precisely *why* this needs to be registered as child abuse.
it is trendy. I have seen parents project transgenderism onto their children to get attention.
If the Left and the media are so against body shaming, why do they repeatedly shame President-Elect Trump's appearance?
Because the Leftist agenda takes precedence over all else.  Gay but love conservative ideas?  - You will be bashed and laughed at by the left.  Have dark skin and aren't in lock-step with liberal drivel?  - You will be labeled an Uncle Tom and shunned.  Are you a woman who might not agree that abortion on demand is a cool thing?  -  You are obviously a bible thumper and are open for scorn and ridicule.    The Left Wing cares not for people, it only wants power to control.
Hate speech. They are the masters of hate speech and spew it eagerly. Makes them feel better for some weird reason. SAD.
Which is so weird because he's in pretty good shape.  Did you see the recent pic of him out on a morning jog?  [Not bad for a busy 70yr old](http://i.imgur.com/csfn8XB.jpg) 
I think he looks great. Yeah, he's got a few extra pounds but he carries them well. He's also got a great sense of humor, which goes a long way. And he dresses really well.   Fuck the haters.
I make a sort of easy flowchart for you.  are you a liberal---no---You can take insults  are you a liberal---yes---therefore you are sensitive and need to be treated with clubiness.  Bonus, here's the "flowchart" for minority privilege.  Are you a minority (or a woman)---no---Fuck off  Are you a minority (or a woman)---yes---are you a liberal---yes---enjoy your minority privilege  Are you a minority (or a woman)---yes---are you a liberal---no---Fuck off you; race traitor/uncle tom/[fucking dumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8zhhzaVKM)
Notice how they repeatedly attack Trump for being "orange". How tolerant.
Because hypocrisy. I think he's beautiful inside and out.
They're against body shaming because they're lazy fat slobs and don't want anyone to tell them so. But they're better than you so they can say it, just like how they go after white people while still somehow saying they aren't racist.
Hypocrisy at its finest  > He is a man who preaches hate and intolerance.  > He is a misogynist who judges women on their looks.  > He is a man who threatened to reject the election results.  > I will not accept this despicable, orange faced, toupee wearing man as my president
1) Because he's a conservative   2) Because he's fucking a white male.
Because they're the biggest hypocrites that have ever existed. They're firm believers in do as I say not as I do. I've never met a more prejudiced, judgmental group of people in my entire life. Tolerant left my ass.
Most seem to lack the self awareness to spot their own hypocrisy. I believe many have lost all objectivity, which makes them closed-minded morons
I'm a left leaning independent who greatly dislikes Trump (and Hillary), but I saw this on /r/all and came on in to say **you're absolutely right**. It's hypocritical and despicable.
Look in a thesaurus. Liberal is apparently a synonym for Hypocrite.
Because in reality most people on the left couldn't care less about these things.  They just use these side issues as ammunition to substitute for bad ideas on real issues.  Unable to articulate or defend why your ideas are worth implementing??  No problem.  Just shout "sexist."
It's all about control.  These Power-Hungry Global Statists will attack and bully anyone who disagrees with them, based on looks, disability, race, ethnicity, belief, sexuality, ANYTHING - without apology.   They don't have to follow the rules; they just make them for us.  
Because everything they say is the opposite of what they do. Think about it. Every single thing they claim, the right does and they do the opposite. 
Its called the liberal double standard.  You may have noticed the hypocrisy throughout the campaign and post election.  some examples  *  Body shaming = check  *  Burning symbols = check (Quran vs Flag) *  Accepting election results = check *  Big Money and Big Business in Politics Are Bad, Unless They Support the Left? = check *  Bruce Springsteen and Bryan Adams Get to Follow Their Consciences, but the Baker and Florist Don’t? *  Censorship is okay, as long as it censors views I disagree with = check
The same reason why they love free speech, but when they get an ounce of power, they use it to silence the opposition.  The same reason why they are pacifists, but the moment they physically outnumber the other side, they embrace mob violence.  The same reason they see Christianity as repressive, yet they refuse to criticize Islam.  Because they're full of shit. 
Damn, even as a liberal, I have to admit that is a fair point to make.   I swear this election has brought out the idiots on my side of the political spectrum.
They have no self awareness because their brains operate at a low level. They champion feminism and are against body shaming but will say Trump has a tiny penis.
Liberals are everything that they claim to hate. Duh.
for the same reason they suck islam's cock but hate conservative christians: because they are braincontrolled
Not just Trump but the shit they said about his wife is just disgusting. The Tolerant left at work.
those rules don't apply to white males, we picked the wrong gender and race when we were born.
They hate us cuz they ain't us
You know why?? Because if you're a white male they don't give a shit how much they insult you.
Remember how those chicks on the View said Carly Fiorina looked "demented" and when she called them out, they were like "you have to be ready for this kind of criticism if you become president"? So evil! 
Because it's only wrong when we do it /s <-- it's sad that I need that
Their rules only apply to us, silly!  :)
Because he is a republican. The rules only apply across the isle. 
Because he isn't a fat female minority. 
Its the last resort when you are losing and throwing a temper tantrum. Remember your childhood, when all else fails and you lose you scream "Yea...well you're fat!"  Now obviously the liberal left will say "Okay, Trump himself and the right in general mocks people on appearance all the time". I wont deny we do, but the difference is we dont deny it. We dont pretend to not make fun of fat or ugly people like Lena and Amy. The left however is all about acceptance no matter how unhealthy you are or what kind of life style you choose...unless of course they disagree with you, then you're automatically a target. Ex: Rape Melania, Trump is ugly, Get off the stage you fat f*.
Because he becomes more handsome each day
Their social justice rules and "laws" are inconsistent as fuck.  Their blatant contradiction and hypocrisy is as hilarious as it is infuriating.  I believe it's the main reason that keeps the social justice movement from truly legitimizing. The average person recognizes the bullshit of it all.  
Because they're hypocrites
They are also against racism but ok if BLM does it.
No bad tactics, only bad targets. That is the mantra they live by.
It's one of the only things they have against him.
For the answer to this question and more: Try asking Ana Kasparian.
Because they are hippocritical babies.
Just ask Linda Tripp
Because, you cannot damage a diamond.
They think that's the worst insult you can throw at somebody (they're not very smart).
The same reason they call Anne Coulture a cunt, they aren't really virtuous its just a tactic.
Leftists are all pussies that got bullied in high school. They are not for anything, only against anyone or anything with higher real value than them. 
Because you're not allowed to be proud of your physical appearance if you're healthy and white. And especially not if you're 'fucking, a white male.'
Because that's what the left uses to divide and put people in one box or another, and how they control their constituents. Remember when Melania was mocked in front of the award show? What if someone did that to Michelle Obama?   Leftists can never be racist or sexists because they fall in line and support the DNC regardless of who they run or what they do. Hillary's campaign message this election was "I'm a woman and if you oppose me you're a sexist." Classic ploy to distract people from her lack of ideas. 
They can't handle The Big D.
Jealousy.
Ask Ana Gasbaggian.
Simple, the left isn't against body shaming. When the left says something that is either an unattainable ideal or it is a misdirect. The liberal mentality is egocentric, narcissistic and inherently delusional. 
Because HYPOCRITES! They also claim to value tolerance, yet attack, bully, and harass people with different political opinions. 
They do not want to talk about the issues.  They will do anything to avoid the subject matter of DJT's proposals, *because they are reasonable.*  It starts right at the top of the party.  Bill and Hillary decided that Trump would be a formidable candidate, for for that reason, decided to pursue a campaign to attack his character as “dangerous and bigoted.”     https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/59194  A flippant attack on a candidate's appearance ALSO avoids talking about the issues.
The Hillary supporters are paranoids.  They accuse others of that which they try to hide in themselves.  The events of the last three weeks have exposed them for what they are.    1. They are willing to overthrow a national election to get their way   2. They desperately want Americans to be put out of work   3. They desperately want to deprive men of wives   4. They desperately want to deprive women of husbands   5. They desperately want to stop families from having babies   6. They encourage violence against their opponents  7. They nominated a felon for the presidency   8. They lie and cheat to get their way   9.  Their new campaign strategy is to accuse all male Republican candidates of rape   10.  They think half of America is deplorable  
because they don't actually care, coming from an ex-extreme-leftist. they really, genuinely, do not care about their own values unless it's benefiting them. they'll bend their own morals for their benefit.
"RULES FOR THEE, NOT FOR ME"
Because he's FUCKING A WHITE MALE and is exempt

They're going after Melania and even Kellyanne's looks too.  Kellyanne is a work horse. Who the heck cares if she doesn't have time to make herself some pretty makeup mask for those democrat dunces. She has bigger fish to fry. 
I miss Trump! Can't wait for the victory tour!
Trump is a VERY handsome man with beautiful children. Unfortunately, Killary cannot make the same claim.
[deleted]    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4182   > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/86339)
I bring up this same point in debates.  Here is how it goes every time:  Them:  Trump said mean things about [insert female]'s looks.  That is sexist!  Me:  if they're making fun of his hair, skin color, and small hands how is that any different  Them:  well he's running for President and it's not presidential to call people names!  Me:  Hillary called Trump supporters a basket of deplorables  Them:  yeah by most of Trump's supporters are racist, sexist, xenophobic bigots so she's only telling the truth
The guy is 70 years old and looks 50. I'd kill to look that good at that age 
Because they can't stand that their socialist mascot Bernie sanders is a creepy, bald grandpa. Weak, pathetic.
Because it's only bad to shame features that are considered debilitating. Look at our president, is there anything in his appearance that debilitates him? He's handsome and tall, so the left just make pitiful stabs at his appearance because they can't find anything wrong with him 
Their whole platform is based on hypocrisy, we know this.
Honestly for being as old as he is he looks pretty amazing. Super high energy!
Look how they attack how republican women look?  Bodyshaming is just a SJW way to stifle complaints about poor lifestyles. 
We have the best facial expressions don't we folks?
Simple.  Do as I say, not as I do. 
What is there to shame? The guy is a stud. We should all look as good at 70.
It's like the woman from TYT who fat shamed Alex Jones after making videos saying it's not okay for people to fat shame. 
It's almost as if there are liberals who are easily offended and liberals who couldn't care less
He's not even bad looking  just an old man with a bad haircut
Because they're purple haired and fat.
I think President Elect Trump is a very handsome man! Seriously. I've always thought that.  People who make fun of another person's appearance are actually very insecure people inside.  They are just showing that they are insecure. Sad.
Because the rules don't apply when it comes to Trump, we've seen this the entire election. It's cool to harass and degrade fellow citizens so long as they support trump. Even Reddit, spaz goes on his public tantrum about how big bad T_D is harassing subs yet ETS had a top /all spot directly antagonizing this sub. But it's cool cause it's against TD. 
I've never heard this point be made, but I really like it.
Because they are hypocrites.
rules for thee but not for me
Because otherwise they wouldn't have anything to say
They should Change their name to " THE HIPPOCRATIC PARTY"
because they aren't really.
Because they are stupid dumb idiots
Wow, has no one here ever thought about punching up and punching down? Bullies are effective because they go after people who are already down and marginalized. Good Comedians go after people who are privileged and point out what flaws they have. This can be seen in many cultures.   But bullying is easier, I know.
Because he's a white male obv.
Because the rules they make up for others don't apply to *them*, silly!
Because human nature always overrides human decency.  The sooner liberals recognize that this isn't a symptom of political persuasion, the sooner we can come together and start actually solving problems again.
>Left : all peoples sexuality should be respected and accepted  - Right wing married guy dates his male intern  >Left : HAHA WHAT A CLOSET HOMO PIECE OF SHIT
Because shame and stigmatization are the only way leftists know how to get what they want.
Anyone else just admiring the quality of that gif though.  r/highqualitygifs 
Because they're not real people. 
They also mock him for his stance on immigrants (which I personally disagree with) but then shame his immigrant heritage with all that "Drumpf" bullshit.  Totally hypocritical.
YOU PREACH HATE YOU GET HATE  spez: RRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Same reason they'll scream racial slurs in the face of any minority who escapes the Lib plantation. Same reason they were so vicious and so hateful toward Sarah Palin. They don't have real principles, and they don't have integrity. They're a cult, and they get angry when their faith is questioned or threatened.
It's all OK as long as you're a white male.  Even my own asian friends say racist shit to me.  I don't care so I don't call em out on it.  But guess who votes for Democrats and calls me a racist?  Same friends.  Am I racist?  Nope.  I am an asshole though. 
Top post on pics. <3 The_Donald. Fuck /u/spez
i was always told it was bad to judge people based on the color of their skin yet the left constantly hectors me about how trump is a bad orange man
PODESTA EMAILS REVEAL COLBERT IS DIRECTLY INSTRUCTED BY POLITICIANS ON WHAT TO PUT ON HIS SHOW (DISGUSTING)
But he's "just a comedian," why would powerful political entities want anything to do with the influence his show might have had?   Oh that's right, that comedian excuse is horseshit.
Imagine my surprise.  I would be more surprised to find out that there was actually a TV pundit NOT on the payroll of politicians.

Nothing is surprising anymore: the entire tv is fake turn it off.
Colbert, Stewart and Oliver all lost every little shred of integrity they appeared to have built up. Stewart masked his cuckholdry with smugness, and Colbert did it....with smugness, but then there was Oliver who...wait no he's a smug cunt too.
Can we take down all these late night hacks? It's the fucking current year.
Colbert, the Daily Show, all proving themselves to be part of the Fake News establishment.
Hillary should have hired funnier operatives
The MSM is an extension of the DNC. 
And to think I used to watch that crap...
Colbert: Trump U, bad. CGI U, good. 
Bastards!!
Fuck you Steven.
As if we didn't know. The shows pretty much follow same template and spew same garbage lies and propaganda.
I'm shocked. (I'm not shocked)
[Is this what they're talking about?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evtlunon49E)
I didn't realize so many people weren't attached to their souls. It's really sad though, I actually did use to like Colbert.
how do you think he went from cable to MSM? people don't just "get the job"... 
Colbert always sucked and cucked.  Eff him and his smug, elitist attitude.
I used to watch him..maybe 3 years ago. He is so predictably bias and boring. Not funny. But now clearly a puppet. Terrible. 
I can't believe we missed this one. Podesta we have your emails!!
I get laughed at in other subreddits when I talk about liberal propaganda yet all the proof you need is in the emails.
Did they have pizza after the show? Just askin'...
I treid watching the Late Show last night. Every joke in the monologue was about Trump---every one. And it was stuff like "so the weather sucks, just like Donald Trump." Then the crowd goes WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. It got old really fast. I get it, he is the President elect and they should have jokes about them. But every joke night after night is way overboard. I switched over and watch Jimmy Fallon for the erst of the night because he attempts at comedy and not an entire show based on insults to one person. Colbert was fine when he had the Report because it was a political show about politics. The Late Show isnt supposed to be taht. The only people I can see watching are liberals who need nightly reinforcement that they are really the smart ones and they are actually better than those other people who can make a career. 
Will put the word out there. Though it may seem trivial to us in the greater scheme of things, this is a big blow to his TV audience.
FAKE FAKE NEWS!!!  That's too damn funny.
It shouldn't surprise anybody that Colbert is a DNC shill.
Colbert sucks balls
Colbert wrote Obamas WCD speech this year. I know because he plagiarized a joke from when had done it a couple years prior. And they had th Gaul to come out and say Melania was plagiarizing. Fuck off Colbert. Your mother would be sickened by your traitorness
[deleted]
 When I was a hardcore liberal there was always something cathartic about the Daily Show and Colbert Report. I was a history major at a low tier state school with no job prospects and a bunch of other problems that were my own creation (which I didnt own up to. It wasnt *my* fault, it was Bush and conservatives that did everything wrong to me). But when watching them at night they told me I was right and those other, successful people were wrong. It made poor life choices seem like the correct ones. I was on the right side of history and even though I had no skills and a degree I could get the same knowledge from by visiting the library, I was the one who was right and good.   I remember when Stewart debated the Jim Cramer guy from the CNBC show. It was billed like Cramer was *the* cause for the recession and Stewart was going to take him to task. We even had watching parties and felt so smug when he was mean to this guy whose only crime was hosting a cable show no one watched where all he did was read the stock quote page of the newspaper.   Then you grow up and you realize, by and large and with few exceptions, you and everyone else in life is where they are  because of decisions they made--not because a wallstreet banker did something with a derivative.   I always wondered why the working class voted Republican when "it wasnt in their best interest." I had to move back to my small hometown and live next to people who were machinists and plumbers and the like. I resented them because *I* had been to college and I was sooo much smarter and better than these conservatives---Stewart and Colbert told me so.   Well, after you sober up you have a realization that maybe they made a good decision of not taking on debt for school (I didnt have student loans but you get the point) and they have marketable skills where as I didnt. Maybe they were conservative because they understood where they were in life and didnt want to pay handouts to other people who refused to do any work or try to improve themselves. They accepted where they were and enjoyed their life, they didnt feel entitled to everything solely because they had the correct opinions (like I did). If they wanted to move up, they worked harder or retooled and easily accomplished it, they didnt wallow in the intoxication of resentment and blame others.   Then I started to think about the shows like the Colbert Report, Daily Show, MSNBC, and all of that. And I realized it was like a drug. It didnt help me, it actually hurt, but it made me feel so incredibly good. And I needed more and more of the drug to feel good--hence the virtue signaling and one-upping people to make me more progressive than them.   I know people the same age as me who went to the same crappy college and they are pretty close to being millionaires now because they majored in a good field and made good decisions. They were conservatives and understood that you need to have skills to make a living and in America you can be anything regardless of who and what you are. I chose the different path of failures and blaming ambiguous others for them (bankers, the elite, whatever).   So what am I getting at here? well, liberalism is like a self fulfilling prophecy. You are told the private sector and having a good job is neutral at best but usually evil. And studying useless stuff because you are interested in it is good. Now, there is nothing wrong at all with volunteering and non-profits, Im not saying that. But you are subtly instructed to end up on the economic fringes; to be a martyr. You are told to make bad decisions in everything from career to family matters. Then you are in a position where you are down and out and have to rely on the government to take care of you. Then you vote Dem so your goodies dont get taken away. Then these people get elected again and again. These shows are a part of that.   I dont miss being smug and I am over the resentment for my choices. I am now focused on making the best that I can. And as I was once a true believer, I know all their arguments and can tell you that any liberal can fix their problems in 99 weeks with a haircut, attitude change, and an associates degree.   These shows are frustrating because they are propaganda masked in TV opium. I find it hard to watch them anymore because I see through the BS. I understand why Clinton lost the rust belt and it wasn't because of racism. It was because people who work hard and keep to themselves and are sick of being told they are what is wrong with the country (and world). I guess it isnt surprising the Colbert folks were trying to get Podesta approval, I would have been ok with it back in the day. But just think of the lefts reaction if this had been a comedians staff talking to the Romney campaign or something.   Thanks for reading my rant. 
I mean, it's not like it wasn't obvious already that he was just a tool. It's truly disgusting and I'd be ashamed to be in his position. And to think of all the people who get their politcal info from those shows. Puppets.
Hey Cucks! Why are you here downvoting this? Shouldn't you already have this sub filtered out from r/all? Or did you praise u/[redacted] for nothing?

I loved the daily show with Stewart and the Colbert Report. Mostly because they used to make fun of legitimate republican dumb-ass-ery.   But once Colbert's new show started tanking and he began just shitting on trump for fuck all, is when I lost all respect for him. Yeah we get he's orange. Yeah "haha" he wants to bang his daughter. But it gets fucking old after the 2nd time you say it.   His nutless sac is only there now to keep the dust out his asscrack. 
Called us nazis. he went off script to say the media caused this. Then went back calling Trump supporters nazis the next. 
remember when jon stewart went on crossfire and said "you're hurting america with your lies?"  what a fucking hypocrite.  and now he defends hillary and ignores what they did to sanders.  absolutely no integrity.
And this surprised no one 
I've always hated the daily show, colbert, trevor noah, and john stewart.. ever since I first saw it I recognized it as basically shilling hiding as "comedy"   When a comedian is constantly "roasting" politicians but never criticizes the other side, you know they are simply shills.. 
One of the things that really got me about Colbert was his election night monologue. He talked all melancholic about how "tragic" it was that American politics have become so polarized, and how it wasn't always like that.   Well who's fault is that? It's certainly not the people who host one-sided comedy shows that trash anything right-wing at every angle /s
I have been making the argument for years that him and Jon Stewart are shills for the deficit spending industrial complex.  One does not simply borrow trillions of dollars without paid clowns to distract and discredit the opposition. 
Ah this is why Colbert stopped being funny! I was talking about this the other day with my friend. He was funny on the Colbert Report then one day he just started taking himself really seriously and stopped being funny.

The people who talked about the left wings total control of the media a few years ago were treated like conspiracy nuts. Little did we know how right they were.
Damn I really loved Colbert's work. Not like the liberal stuff but you know, like his character and his work.  After this, I can't look at him the same
#Colbert has become a cheap political hack. His show needs to be cancelled.
Colbert the cuck
Had to work with a bunch of libtards at Tesla who worship Colbert. Glad the disgusting little troll is OUTED!
Time to burn this fucker down.
This pisses me off so much because I have dumb liberal friends that only watch damn John Oliver and Colbert, but it's so obviously propaganda, they are so blind.
Not surprised at all. He's changed A LOT from his Colbert Report days, where he was a caricature of Bill O'Reilly (only idiots believed he was actually being a conservative). Sure he was making fun of the right, but he did it in a way that made you laugh.  Nowadays, he's just on stage whining about things not going the globalist way like we just voted in Satan himself. It's not entertainment anymore. It's a soapbox and apparently not even HIS soapbox. 
I used to like him but he became insufferable.  I'm not surprised by this. 
like that wasnt feckin obvious to begin with
Ahhh it's nice to see Podesta emails at the top of this ~~sub~~ dom again :)
i loved colbert in the 90s, its really sad to see him become such a slimy little weasel
Well, that sucks. Guess I won't be watching his stuff ever again.
That explains why he isn't funny
COLBERT HIGHLY CUCKED
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9663  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/37830)
His ratings suck. 
pathetic. It's all so evil
Sad sad sad.
'member when people watched late night talk shows?  I 'member.
This 1984 style of information control and subsequent warfare is really putting a sour taste in my mouth. It's not necessarily 'scaring' me, but hell if this continues, we're going to have a battle on our hands.
It's pretty obvious though, most of the commentary/jokes are always with a pro-democrat slant. Most of the comedy shows are for cucks, by cucks.
Hurrrr durrr right wing conspiracy hur durr 
As the great Bill Hicks would have said: Colbert is sucking Satan's cock.
IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF WE TRIGGERED THE SHILLS ON R/ALL (it wouldn't)
What is the WJC?
I should be surprised by this, but you watch the show, you see how anti-everything he is against Trump, without so much as a 'well Hillary may not be much better.' and it's blantant.  FFS, if they were any good at their job at all, they could've done this on the sly and we'd have never noticed, but apparently Hillary is terrifying enough to get people to piss themselves and become fanatical, to the point where they destroy their own careers.
I've always disliked Colbert and john Stewart. It feels like you're watching them give a blowy to Obummer every time they are on.
can someone put together a side-by-side of jon stewart / colbert / the nerd oliver guy / the black trevor guy   VS.  Hunger games propaganda? They have alot of similarities in the dumbass brainwashing they frame as comedy
Ok, we're on to the Democratic strategy right? Control the narrative any way you fucking can, in any media outlet you fucking can. This is how 47% of Americans are brainwashed into believing shitty leftists platforms.
So we have unavoidable proof here of propaganda from the left and no one cares lol 
Way too many "I love Jon Stewart" comments in here. Jon Stewart has been and always will be a cuck. If you still love Jon Stewart you haven't been completely red pilled and you are a cuck. 
I remember these episodes and it was pretty obvious that they were done in partnership with the CGI.  this is a red herring folks.  also can I point out that the kid who posted this is 13 years old and titles his posts like a wannabe youtuber.  this is embarrassing to the sub.  why people don't take us seriously 
Anyone notice that that this asshole misspelled "American progress" in the email?  I would be willing to bet that this guy was trying to send the email to Podesta at his @americanprogress.org account but it kept getting kicked back...  These are the people running shit? SAD!
An articulate, charming complete hack.
#ACTIVE MEASURES
This seems like nothing, guys. The St Louis event was not a secret.   Edit: actually nevermind, the bit asking for feedback from the DNC, that's pretty over the top. 
Couldn't fool me. All of them are annoying. Bee, Oliver, Noah, Wilmore.  http://thefederalist.com/2016/11/11/how-jon-stewart-and-the-daily-show-elected-donald-trump/
This does not shock me in the least.  But let me tell you what... WE ARE AT THE TOP OF REDDIT.  WE CAN NOT BE STOPPED! MAGA!
So happy to see this on the front page.
I actually had respect for this guy, wow, fucking dirtbag. 
#I SAID IT ALL ALONG... JON STEWART, COLBERT, DAILY SHOW, MAHER, THIS IS ALL POISON FOR THE MIND AND UNFUNNY ASDHOLES.  STEWART IS FULL OF SHIT AND I AM WILLING TO HAVE LUNCH WITH HIM AND DENIRO.  I SWEAR I WON'T USE MY DEWALT DRILL 20V ON THEIR KNEES SO THEY STOP LYING.  
Has CNN cleared this for us to read yet?  We need to wait for their permission first.
Wikileaks: the gift that never stops giving.
I hope he has to answer to this now. I would also like you, STEVEN, to admit to writing Obamas recent White House Correspondence Dinner speech. Lame stealing ur own jokes.
Anything broadcast on the main stream media is a lie. That's how it works. That's why they don't like Trump. He won't read out their propaganda.
God, I've missed these leaks!  I really really missed these leaks!  I'm so happy right now. Thank you OP!
Colbert a Clinton shill, though it isn't exactly shocking to hear, I'm quite disappointed
I am really disappointed to see this. I am an independent so I have liberal and conservative views. I always thought Colbert was pretty funny on CC and seemed like a genuine guy who was "fighting the good fight". Nope just another puppet.
At least they were funnier than John Oliver the official Clinton fan-girl. Five weeks of Trump bashing bored the shit out of me. 
#RiggedMedia
I would be more surprised if he wasn't tbh, politicians figured out how to influence young voters through entertainment-news decades ago.
That explains why Colbert wanted to smear Donald Trump as a nazi. It's the democratic play book. 
BILL INTRODUCED TO END FEDERAL MARIJUANA PROHIBITION CAN WE TELL OUR LAWMAKERS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL?
Tax the weed to pay for the wall. Destroys Mexican drug cartels which indirectly forces Mexico to pay for the wall.  Two birds, one stone.
It's less dangerous than Alcohol and there's too many people in jail because of possession of it. It also feeds cartel's pockets by it being illegal. Regulate and tax it! I used to be a pothead, not anymore. Still, I recognize that banning this substance is hurting more than helping. 
A very clear states rights issue. No matter your thoughts on the plant this is a slam dunk for self governance and liberty.
This will hurt the Cartels. The Deep State would like to continue the so called "War on Drugs" due to their unholy alliance with the Cartels. 
I've literally never posted in this subreddit, and I'm a very liberal person who voted for Hillary Clinton (idk if this is bannable here, again, never posted here before).  That all said, it makes me happy to see The_Donald supporting legalization for all of the obvious reasons - legalize it, tax it, regulate it, it's less harmful than alcohol and legalizing it would hurt the very drug cartels that wreak havoc in Mexico and Central America, which contributes to people trying to flee to the United States to escape violence (mostly from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatamala). It's really a win-win-win-win.  Considering how big the divide often seems between democrats, republicans, Trump supporters, etc., it's extremely refreshing to see something that most people can agree on.
The federal government's stance on marijuana is one of its most blatant hypocrisies, and that's saying something.   It's classified as schedule 1, meaning no medicinal properties whatsoever. This is blatantly anti-science. And also hypocritical, because the federal government owns patents on medical marijuana.  This gives common folk a huge reason to distrust government and a disregard for following laws. It puts way too many non-violent people in prison where they become violent. If you want more people to have faith in government and to feel good about following the law, then this is the first thing you change.

This might be the first time I've ever upvoted r/The_Donald.  I completely agree with this one however.
If this makes it to r/all reddits gonna implode

#END PROHIBITION
Even if you don't agree with the use of weed, you for sure agree there's better uses for taxpayer dollars other than mass incarceration for a plant every and their mother can grow literally anywhere 
If you're pro personal liberties and anti federal oversight you are pro weed whether you know it or not 
[removed]
I believe Justin Amash co-sponsored this today.
The smartest thing we can do right now is make this 100% legal. It will create a new industry(jobs), tax revenue, and relieve pressure on law enforcement/prisons. People are going to smoke pot anyway why not bring it out into the open?
DO IT. So much money will be generated for America.
Make America the top world exporter of hemp and industrial hemp materials!  That will bring the jobs!
I may not agree with everything that The_Donald supports, but I'm glad that we can agree on this topic.
You really have to wonder why Obama avoided this topic during his 8 years.
The rest of reddit is with you today, r/t_d
Who in their right mind is downvoting this?    Tax weed, end the cartels.  
If Trump passes this, then I will vow to support Trump. Sorry just a lurker right now. 
[removed]
r/all right now:  wtf i love the drug war now
I don't agree with you all for supporting someone like Sessions, however atleast you understand weed is something that should be decriminalized.
I do not really like donald trump but it makes me very happy this can be a bipartisan issue we can all agree on. You guys give me hope. 
People get so tweaked out by scary ol mary jane. It affects people in different ways, just like alcohol does. As a recent college student, being around drunk fucks was the worst thing to deal with. And for those who have never tried, you'd be surprised how many people around you might be blazed yet remain excellent productive individuals to society. Alcohol makes the right people stupid. Marijuana makes the right people stupid. It's about knowing how things affect you, know your body and have responsibility. There is a thing called alcoholism and we all know people who have it. A friend of mine has a alcoholic father and when he needed surgery on his liver they were all like wtf. I'm like duh stupid. If you like getting drunk and talk shit on weed you're lame af.
#KILL THE CARTELS  #MAKE AMERICA PROSPEROUS AGAIN  #BTFO MALIK'S BROTHER'S LEGACY EVEN MORE  #WIN OVER SHITTY LEFTISTS  #LANDSLIDE 2020   **seriously, just look at Colorado you incompetent government fucks**
Holy shit! Something on The_Donald that I agree with. Ladies and gentlemen we have found the middle ground. 
This post on the top of T_D proves I'm on the right side.   
Let's meme the fuck out of this Pedes!!! We have the will we have the power and we have the technology!!!!  FUCK THE CARTEL!!!
The donald is pro weed. Yay
This is the most progressive thread I've ever seen on /r/The_Donald. I love it. You guys are alright. 
Marijuana is schedule I, making it classified in the same bracket as heroin. Congress needs to fix that retarded shit. 
>With the recent confirmation of militant marijuana prohibitionist Jeff Sessions  I think that's a bit sensationalist
While we're at it, I'd like to see farmers grow hemp for industrial use with little bureaucratic hassle.
Weed has been illegal for far too long, another example of big corporations(pharmaceutical company's) lobbying against the wants and needs of the American people.
The sheer medicinal positives outweigh any negatives by a mile it's only a matter of time 
As a non Trump supporter, I've never been happier to have the pedes one my side.
[removed]
The federal government has zero jurisdiction to outlaw pot or any other substance. That Constitution gives that power solely to the states.  They had to pass the 18th Amendment to outlaw recreational alcohol. That was legal and Constitutional. There has been no amendment to outlaw any other substance, including pot. Until that happens only the States have authority to decide whether it is legal or not.  The FDA and DEA are entirely un-Constitutional, just shutter them. Criminal law is solely the purview of the states. Feds just made up the idea they can ban a substance.  Every *federal* agent that put a pothead in jail is a kidnapper. Full Stop.  The Feds have been violating the Constitution for about a century, not just this.  America could be saved if the government would obey the Constitution.
I can't wait for people to flip on weed the nanosecond Trump expresses a modicum of support for this bill. wtf i hate weed now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please support this. As a Greenpede I don't want to be supporting sketchy dealers, let my choice help support our nation.
Fuck Yeah TrumpEnts!
"hey I wonder if redacted will have this legitimately big news story on their sub"   -goes to check, finds front page full of propaganda.   I shouldn't even be surprised anymore. It they plug their ears and close their eyes then the Trump administration can't do anything right and they can never be wrong. 
[deleted]
I'm very far left and you guys agree with this too? Let's work together to get it passed then. 
[FIND YOUR REPRESENTATIVE](https://www.govtrack.us/)  CALL YOUR REPRESENTATIVE
Called Mike Bishop the day I saw this go up! Should hear from him soon I hope. It was introduced by a Republican too!!!  https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1227  This stuff has helped me not kill myself.  We vets with need this.  Was at the VA and causally talk about marijuana with my doctor all of the time.  THIS NEEDS TO PASS  spez: https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1227/BILLS-115hr1227ih.pdf
Golden opportunity to support states rights and starve some cartels 
The drug war has failed. Time for something different.
WTF I hate weed now
Who the hell do i need to call and bug about getting this passed? Southern Texaa if that helps
<3 THIS IS WHY I LOVE THE_DONALD. When I heard about the crack down on federal marijuana my heart honestly sunk...I was so sure Mr.President would finally allow for the end of federal war on marijuana. I'm not an imbecile, however, I do enjoy smoking weed. I don't drink and I don't smoke tobacco. 
I'm not a weed smoker anymore - I quite years ago - but I've always felt it should be something that is a legal choice for adults.  It's definitely no worse than alcohol, and on top of that it grows naturally in the earth.  What's next, a prohibition on carrots?  I love the idea of legal weed taxes to pay for the wall and bankrupt the cartels, all at once!
[deleted]
Grow American, buy American. 
What the fuck I hate Marijuana now
This is one issue that virtually everyone in their right mind agrees with, do it
This is one of those things where the right looks at the left and wonder who's against it?  And then we remember it's mostly corrupt politicians against it.
I live in Miami Florida. Who do I need to call?
I love it. I am 100% pro weed and this sub is too. I talk to my family who is conservative and they act like weed is the devil. Terrible they don't see the benefits.
Don't forget meme magic is real lads. We can make this happen. 
Want to talk about exponential job growth? End the ban on marijuana; tons of jobs will be created from this, framing Trump as the ultimate job creator.
Great to see this here! and I hope the President will voice some support, at least that he will sign this bipartisan legislation.  they can certainly consider it part of fixing the broken healthcare system.  
As a non-Trump supporter, I respect the subreddit for this.  Good day.
I hate drugs and will never smoke the whacky tobacky, but at this point in time I think it should be legalized at the federal level and taxed/regulated at the local level.
States can still ban it if they choose and I always prefer a state's rights position over a federal one. Anyways, the unwashed hippies need to chill and this should help. Also, it will BTFO the Mexican cartels and create new small business and industry. Plus, enforcement of unpopular law is expensive and our cops should be focused on stopping real crime. Seems like a good idea to me.
Finally something we can all agree on!  Let's all smoke the peace pipe!
Let's dispel the notion that drugs are illegal because the government thinks they are dangerous. Drugs are illegal because the Deep State funds its operations with drug money and that money has no oversight. Until the deep state is dismantled drugs will not be legal.
Someone needs to post this to r/trees.
We can kill the cartels, get ridiculous amounts of tax dollars from it, and make a ton of people happy. What's not to like about it?
If all Dem congressmen were congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, the world would be a better place.
Fuck the cartels and more tax money for infrastructure?   I CANT HANDLE THIS MUCH WINNING!
I just realized this bill is bipartisan and one of the drafters was the based Tulsi Gabbard! :D 
I'm not signing that anti-Trump screed. They specifically single out Trump and Sessions - without mentioning Jim O’Neill who is fast-tracked for the head of the FDA and is a cannabis proponent.  #HINT THE FDA ASSIGNS AND SCHEDULES SUBSTANCES THAT THE DOJ ENFORCES#  So no NORML - you can shove that anti Trump screed right up your fucking asshole. **AND I WORK SUPPORTING CANNABIS STARTUPS** so get **DOUBLY FUCKED**.
We all know its not going to happen. Trump has a lot more draining to do before this will even be voted on. The private prison lobby will not let this go down without an extreme fight.
Liberals: WTF, I hate liberal drug policy now!
I was a proud supporter of the reeferendum in Colorado and would support this on the federal level as well. I've never smoked weed, but I've been around it enough to know it's not worth going to jail over. Legalize it!
If alcohol prohibition could be lifted, then so can this.  Keep the really bad drugs banned though, please...
Literally just got my medical card. 😂
Even liberals agree, get this shit in
1776 WILL COMMENCE AGAIN  I NEED TO MOVE MY HEMP FARM OUT OF MY BASEMENT AND INTO MY BACKYARD TBH FAM  GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD NEVER HAVE PUT UP WITH THIS SHIT. I HEARD HE LIKED TO SMOKE A LIL REEF EVERY NOW AND AGAIN TOO. WHAT ELSE ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN YOU'VE CONQUERED THE BRITISH AND HAVE NOTHING LEFT TO DO BUT BASK IN YOUR OWN GLORY?
Tax it, cut back on prison spending now that youve got less people incarcerated, and put that money into the government projects
Decriminalization is such a good idea that Obama opposed it.
Reasoning for passing this bill by the left and the right are quite different, it seems...but at least we both want it for the most part.
[deleted]
lol I bet this being on all is triggering a lot of people. "huh I agree with that -- What!!? Its from THE DONALD!!!??" *reevaluates life*
Take the first upvote I've ever given to this sub. If Donald does this, it will be a historic act of true patriotism. It might be the first thing he's done that's truly 'America First.'
Trump fans seem to be strong proponents for legalization. We can't let him botch this. 
Where's our based cannabis smokers at?!? 
posted for 40 minuets and no comments. on a post about legal weed? whats going on reddit?
Can they just legalize this already so it won't keep distracting from REAL issues? Sad!
#Who would have known that this bill is THE great uniter of both sides of the political spectrum. 
wait i agree with something on the_donald?  wtf
http://illegallyhealed.com/former-dea-spokeswoman-marijuana-safe-dea-knows/  Former DEA spokeswoman quote on marijuana:  >Marijuana is safe, we know it is safe. It’s our cash cow and we will never give up,” Belita Nelson told an audience of doctors and nurses at the Marijuana for Medical Professionals Conference in Denver, Colorado this month.  Let that sink in for a moment.  Our keepers know it's safe, and yet they continue to unjustly imprison and fine people over it.  It's ALL about money.  Fucking disgusting.  There should be outrage over this.  They are sacrificing peoples' lives for the sake of swelling their coffers.  Why do we tolerate this?  Scumbags.
I really don't understand the hostility on weed...with TONS of studies and a PROVEN benefits for states that legalize it...I really don't see any major downsides in supporting legalization. I would go even further on a more extreme stance and promote people to explore the possibility to legalize ALL drugs like [Portugal](http://www.alternet.org/story/151635/ten_years_ago_portugal_legalized_all_drugs_--_what_happened_next). This would literally severely damage the drug gangs stronghold that plague this country.

 "You take this little beautiful baby, and you pump — I mean, it looks like just it's meant for a horse and not for a child," Trump said. "We had so many instances [in which] a child had a vaccine, and came back and a week back had a tremendous fever, got very very sick, and now is autistic."

I can't believe I just scrolled through ten pages of pictures of Hillary just to find that one. I feel violated 
Google bombing doesn't work as well as it used to, you guys.
In all seriousness I didn't know about this picture.  Thank you for sharing it.
Pretty sure that KKK uniform picture is photoshopped.
So that's where she got that "super predator" line! Does she repeat everything that old guys with white air say?  Ironic how she is the one getting the black people vote.
What is the context of this picture?

Hillary Clinton and KKK are the same thing. There is no difference between Hillary Clinton and KKK. Leading epigeneticists had once speculated in-utero changes to the fetal structure caused a clear genetic divergence between Hillary Clinton and KKK, but the latest research demonstrates that this perceived divergence is only cosmetic in nature (/pol/ et al, 2016). This new research definitely proves that Hillary Clinton and KKK share no less than 420 of the same genetic markers!

Google image has done a pretty good job at scrubbing any unflattering photo so far when searching "Hillary Clinton."  Wonder how much that cost.
Hillary Clinton is a lier and will say anything to get in the whitehouse.   Just doing my part.

This picture is incredibly misleading, our lord and savior Hillary is trying to actively pull away from this man as evidenced by the grimace and look of horror in her face.   She clearly has no interest in being associated with such a heinous klansmen and would only take his donation because it is rude to say no to money.   I promise I am not being paid by anyone to make this statement.  No one.
Where's the image? What was it?

It's ok buddy, I've seen these posts multiple times every everyday and I upvote it every time.
Congrats. Not a Trump fan but I do hate Hillary. [Nice work](http://imgur.com/1gB4zL7).
As much as most people hate Hillary there is legit ways to criticize and this crap discredits the real stuff people can post about her. It encourages the Bernie Bros notion. This is a real issue but this post will only work against it trying to be raised by any legit news source. Think the boy who cried wolf
Yes but it is representative of the fact that he was in the KKK, which is unadulterated fact.
The reason is because that image URL and the code within has absolutely no mention of Hillary. Further, Google's search engine results algorithm, simply put, punishes pages that blatantly spam the same words over and over. For my sanity, I assume most people who are spamming in this thread are joking, but it hurts my brain to know that even one person might think spamming in the comments section is actually conducive to making this image show up in searches. Now, if somehow a thread like this did manage to have a compromising image appear in search results, would she pay to have results tailored? Yeah probably.       TL;DR: This thread is full of people who have no clue how SEO works and are actually diminishing the odds of this thread and/or picture ever appearing in search results
Trump Supporters Raise Nearly $24,000 For Muslim Immigrant-Owned Limo Torched by Left-Wing Protesters
#DO WE LOVE OUR LEGAL IMMIGRANTS, FOLKS?
Why is this in "What's hot," with zero upvotes?
Wait...but....how? Aren't we bigots who hate muslims? 🤔
It's a tale as old as time: crybaby idiots who haven't worked a hard day in their life destroy things, and we grownups clean up their mess. The circle of life.
And THAT is what MAGA is all about! 
Nothing will convince Liberals.
Remind me again who are the good guys? Leftist anarchist destroy immigrants way to make money and Trump supporters help him up again!   #MAGA
Let's keep this sort of charitable work up, folks!
Actual tolerance
This is the difference between virtue signaling and actually being virtuous.
We have hearts and strive to do the right thing
RIP narrative
Just posted this to CuckBook, here is a response from one of my favorite leftist cucks.  "Haha wow you're right this totally makes up for signing this terrible executive order, as well as appointing a man with less than zero military experience head of the NSC, as well as being the lowest-approved President in our nation's history in record time because you're an overgrown manchild with babysized hands and have narcissistic personality disorder and you're the only person on the planet that understands what's really going on even though all observable facts say otherwise!"  I would post a pic, but im not sure on which host to use.  Edit:  that thread got so much longer.  "Uh I don't think anyone is claiming a "complete takeover." It doesn't need to be. And I don't think many people are claiming that Russia hacked actual ballots. Again, not the point. New York Times is not fake news. Washington Post is not fake news. NPR is not fake news. They are public institutions and calling them fake news is harmful to our democracy. If you believe Breitbart and Fox News to be more reliable sources of news than the ones that I just mentioned, it's because you're drinking the kool-aid, and I'm sorry that you're like this."  I drink kool-aid guys, the jig is up. lol
[deleted]
MODS = GODS
To MAGA is to do your part, no matter its relative importance.  Thanks to everybody who did their part here.   **MAGA** 
I love how r/[redacted] harp that its "propaganda" because its breitbart.  All you have to do is just look at their source aka the gofundme and its right there. It's not "fake news."  ffs these redditors are so incredibly brainwashed they can't cope with the fact that people who supported trump can do good.   We also funded that church to be rebuilt.   What the fuck do these losers do if not just whine? 
#MATCH ME BRO 
Who else was going to do it?  Left wing professional protestors don't make any money.  Fucking animals.
The amazing thing is that the opposite headline "Clinton supporters raise nearly $24,000 for USA born owned limo torched by right-wing protesters" is simply impossible from any point of view. 
pretty weird that this doesnt show up on r/all with nearly 13k upvotes in 4 hours...
Rioters, not protestors damnit
Leftists seem to forget that Trump supporters are people too, and that Making America Great Again doesn't stop at the color of one's skin. Well done to all the 'pedes who supported the limo owner.
Lets see how the left will find a way to handwave this
r/[redacted] won't recognize this because it's breitbart. Funny how they will brush away FACTS just because they don't like the source.  Facts are facts, not matter what the source is. A holocaust denier site could report that e = mc^2 and they will deny it because of the source.  Fuck these idiots, honestly.
The absolutely hysterical part about this is over the course of the election I came under attack for supporting Donald Trump. I was called every name in the book and deleted by tons and tons of people for my opinions. I am a teacher. Yes a conservative living in a liberal world. Want to talk about difficult. The judgmental eyes peering at me as if I stole their lunch out of the faculty refrigerator or kicked their dog!   These people who blocked me, banned me, verbally attacked me and assassinated my character are the same calm, loving, tolerant people that committed this awful act, this awful crime against another human being.   Want to talk bad about Trump and his "MUSLIM BAN" (IDIOT MSM) but nobody wants to talk about the millions of muslims here in the United States as well as many other Americans that he is simply trying to protect from terrorism. People handing me statistics like I am some kind of idiot. 9/11 had a less than 1% chance of occurring. Tell that to the families who were left behind to fend for themselves in the wake of those attacks. IDIOTS! FIRED UP MONDAY MORNING BABY! GJ Team Republican. Let's change this country and then the world. 
Why isn't this trending? Oh yeah trump supporters are racist.

Hope this American has enough to buy a new limo nicer than the one that was destroyed by the protesters!
#SUCH RACISTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Typical anti-Trump Protesters "my feelings", "I want" and "my Twitter browny points". Wonder if anyone thought who owns this car? Did they have to sweat their ass off to get it, is it part of their business. Do I have the right to destroy private property, if it's just owned by some well off person?  No, no they didn't and no you don't. All I see is a ton of people who don't give a shit about America or Immigrants who make America great.      
is the gofundme over? i happily tossed in fifty bucks, but the goal was to raise $70,000. get on it, fellow pedes!
I didn't realize there was a go fund me page for this guy until I saw this post. So, I headed right on over and donated a few bucks his way. I hope we can help this man get back on his feet. 
This is why I am proud to be an Aussie deplorable.  Divine kek has bestowed a great importance on us all.
I almost never mass upvote this sub. But whenever CTR starts pulling this shit, I make a point to do that and redpill the libcuck subs too. I wonder how many other dormant pedes like me wake up just to fight censorship.
Good luck seeing this on /r/UpliftingNews 
Look at those donation messages.   It's like a thread here in The Don.   You guys are fuckin amazing.    Who'd I trigger? I'm genuinely proud of you guys. 
You won't catch the liberals doing this. Instead, they would rather ship billions in cash to ISIS. 
OK whats going on in Canada?
But remember, we're the bad guys.
I used to hate this sub, but been here long enough to say holy shit it's good to be a pede!!! 
The Clintards who burned that limo should be arrested and made an example. 10 years in jail.  
[deleted]
we should stop doing this.   >the church. 
They go low, we go high. 
Damn fine work.
Interesting gambit, any evidence to back that up?
# #thingsthatwillnothitthefrontpage or in short # #ttwnhtfp
They claim to be virtuous, but we know them by their fruits.
Yes but protesters chanted "He will not Divide us" like mongoloids in front of a camera in Queens and that's better than replacing a silly limo that was accidentally spray painted and torched 
But CNN told me that Trump supporters are racist & white supremacist neo nazis!!
Can we please not just get into a pissing contest with the liberals about who can give more free money to brown people faster?  I strongly suspect that's a game they feel they win either way.
And the amount of money liberals and CTR donated to just the kind of person they care so passionately about is...  [Drumroll please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itAOGRiYRLI)  $0.00 !!! 
Because of course we HATE Muslims.   Get bent, leftists. 
Guys stop donating money we are supposed to be bad people. You're making dens look bad.
I like how the upvotes on this aren't showing up, but this is #1 on "hot".
Someone get this limo driver a coat.
[deleted]
This is unreal. Such fucking irony it makes me laugh. We are cleaning up their messes! Those liberal protesters have no jobs and literally interfere with the livelihood of those they ostensibly support.
and the only people who will know if this are us here on TD and people who frequent brietbard (us again)  sad...  but you know...muh narrative...and all...
Funny. I don't see the MSM reporting on this. I wonder why that is?
but but... muh narrative 
The damage that was done was $70,000ish. With the charitable donations perhaps a down payment and payment plan can be made towards another to bring the business back running full. 
Oh the irony.... 
So we're better at handling legal immigrants than those who were protesting against us.  It's almost as if we don't do it for the attention daddy never gave us.  
irony...
Someone repost this to r/news and see how many downvotes it gets
"but but but but they're racist!"   - Liberals (probably_) 
Surprised folks haven't acknowledged how staged in the fact this was allowed to happen at all...Think about it. These folks in black could have had suicide vests or the protestors stopping people at check points...Know way they had this place under control or they let it happen...Obamas people were in charge of DHS planning...They wanted the photos of rioting spread all over world. Doesn't give you much confidence. We even had Trump rally folk beaten while cops watched during campaign
Did Pat Green, the country artist donate $1000 to the cause? *Someone* named Pat Green did, I'd like to think it was him as he went to my alma mater and Wave on Wave is a great song. Good job everyone, standup against the hypocrites.
During cold war era the west gave support to radical Muslims for cheap oil.. Now they are the majority.. It's the West's responsibility now to support hardworking moderate Muslims however miniscule they are
I am the 12,999 upvote.  Good job, fam!
It's so fucked up they burned this job creator's limo. I mean what the fuck? Even if you hate Trump... I mean at least be good at being a worthless rioter...
Sources estimating damages 70k to 90k. These rioters should be fined for the cost plus legal fees. Should be required to work off any damages they can't pay.
Great people.
What really sucks is most of these people don't know that Obama banned the same immigrants for 6 months as well and somehow they've raised money for legal fees against Trumps 3 month order.
We have the best fundraisers, don't we folks
No where on the frontpage or /r/all. Insane. 
Did he have insurance on the limo? 
Just donated.
As a man running a limo company wouldnt he be required to have the vechicals insured? Whys he need so much money?
Maybe he will forget the limo and buy a tesla, that will get them going
BEST TAXI IN DC!  Lets get this guy back on the road and back to work like the rest of America!  If you aren't MAGA then you are the enemy.
Can someone get me a BRICK!?
.... Wait, the regressive left is committing acts of violence against Muslims? That's not how any of this works. What is going on?
HUGE WIN FOR TEAM TRUMP HERE FOLKS  CHOO CHOO!!!
Wasn't it the anarchist group who set it on fire?
Correct.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iYVO5bUFww0 
And by left-wing you mean black bloc anarchists. Not actual liberals. They pretty much wreck shit any chance they can get to divide America further. 
I get the sentiment, which is great. The man did not deserve this from insane libs. I am having trouble getting my head around how raising money for someone who owns(ed) a stretch limo is ethical when Flint still has no drinking water. Surely he was insured? 
Yea those dollars got slave owners on em ya bunch of raysis.
Doesn't the car insurance cover the costs?Anyways good move,no car deserves to be burned because some Cucks decided they are angry with their president

So retarded. It was fully insured, his insurance company had to pay for that. Duped by Muslims again!
stupid.  repaying hate with kindness is what got right wingers in this mess.
FAKE NEWS
and despite the liberal narrative--even the Muslim immigrants!!!

Yasssss Baron! They should lower the presidency age to 18 so he can assume presidency right after Trump.
Upvoted before looking, extra kek code?
He's going to become a human-sandworm hybrid and have the knowledge of all human history!
he look dope here
It makes me happy to know how well that boy is [loved](https://i.sli.mg/886hyo.jpg)  Hell I love him too. 
I hope he grows up to be one of those kids who is just so good in every way that even the nasty, regressive lefties can't be critical of him.
I usually don't comply with these memes but I really need my raspberry pi coding to work out for me so I smashed that motherfuckin upvote button.
COMPUTER GENIUS!!!
Thank you Mr Barron

Hi r/all!
I really want Barron to become a meme
I upvoted, but I will try to be quiet and not disturb Barron while he is talking directly to Kek...

*Ordos Chronos directive 145*  *372.M35*  Thought for the day: *An open mind is an empty mind awaiting heresy*  It has come to our attention that there are certain elements using the Warp to facilitate time travel. This one particular element has cogitator level abilities far surpassing anything the Officio Assassinorum Vanus temple or the Tech Masters of the Adeptus Mechanicus are capable of. One report from Inquisitor [REDACTED] states that this element was able to reprogram Necron technology and then utilize some sort of cogitator to disassemble an actual C'tan.  The fact that this element is named BARRON and Terra has records going as far back as Merica showing this name associated with monumental feats of cogitator programming illustrates we are dealing with someone capable of using the warp for time travel.   Another worrying fact is BARRON is also deeply tied to the earliest records of the God Emperor Himself. Incredibly ancient data slates show BARRON being a fundamental aspect of the rise of Humanity during the Golden Age of Technology  We must form an immediate conclave to investigate this element.    **499.M41**  Ordo Malleus directive 774  This is the last known communique that the Ordos Chronos ever issued. It is unknown if the conclave ever took place. All that is known is that the entire Ordos disappeared and was never heard from again.  Thought for the day: *Man is but a single flame against the darkness of the cosmos, only united does our light burn away the darkness.*

That pissed me the fuck off. They completely forgot it was 3 in the morning just to make fun of him. Fuck them for doing that for a 10 year old.
Also who cares if it turns out he is? So what?
Exactly! And it's not like he was lying around watching tv or doing something trivial at 3:00 am! He's a child in a very busy family And on a day like that? compare that to the average ten year old! no wonder he was so sleepy! (Lol now compare that to the poor children of extreme butt hurt libs that night)
I'm a grown ass man and I can barely keep it together past 11
If I recall correctly, the video had a lot of other clips that weren't of him at the acceptance speech. But if he is, so what? Still pretty low to publicly speculate on.
That was that famous **Liberal Tolerance** showing.
Do you have link? Don't remember that 
He stayed up later than Hillary, sad.

This is what an actual Woman's March looks like!

God bless this woman and I hope she wins. As a woman myself there is nothing more insulting than having to bow down to the backward ass policies of these people. I'm glad she took a stand against wearing that rag on her head  and I hope more women begin to do the same. It's ridiculous that a woman is forced to do something like this to appease to another culture just cuz. 
the best part is that there are no people more positively affected and inspired by Le Pen's actions than Lebanese and Muslim women who found out about this.. BTFO feminISISts

#Le Pen is mightier than le hijab
[Meanwhile in the Swedish feminist government](https://www.unwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/women-Swedish.jpg)
Did they really expect she'd do anything different?
Created by someone French I assume?  (should be "scarf" for maximum viral exposure!)  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/ujJobIj.jpg) you go!  And the story for those who haven't gotten it yet:  http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-21/i-will-not-cover-myself-le-pen-refuses-wear-headscarf-cancels-meeting-lebanese-cleri
At this point the Sweden "Feminists" are not even feminists. All they have to offer is a lack of penis. Congratulations on not having a penis? 
She should require all visiting Muslim dignitaries wear a dunce cap if they wish to speak with her.
This is also what a REAL women's march looks like: http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/women-protesting-hijab-1979/
LOL! She's the fucking best. I got a little misty watching her stick up for us lady-folk. <3
This is what a real woman's March looks like. 
Who is this?
This is what feminism looks like
I don't agree with a lot of what you guys say (doesn't mean you don't have the right to say it), but you're right about this lady. Standing up for yourself in that kind of situation takes courage. Good on her, she's a strong example for any young woman to follow, hell even young men
Just curious, how come this is popular on just.  r/The_Donald? 
Good for her. Does anyone have footage?
ANY website, forum post, blogger, quasi-journalist that tries to say 'well, she should've respected their culture and worn it.' is telling you EXACTLY what they think of women.  
She's got more balls than all of Sweden combined. 
Obama would have worn it himself. 
This is what true feminism looks like. It's about choice and dealing with said consequences of that choice, no matter what it is.   If she chose to wear the hijab, the consequences would have been that she appears weak and conforming to a culture that oppresses women. By choosing not to wear it, the consequences are hurting some other countries fee fees.   She made the right choice and feminists everywhere should agree.
Should wiped her ass with that rag and put it on his head!
Le Pen now! Le Pen Forever!
Make France Great Again! Viva Le Pen!
The guy in the top right of the top photo has a look that says "this is not going to go well".
I will *never* understand why the Democrats, who've fancied themselves benefactors to women everywhere for decades, would so blatantly cozy up to a religion that marginalizes, disenfranchises and abuses women in ways that no other organization on earth does.  And many of them have had the audacity to try and *normalize* this insanity and make excuses for it.  Truly baffling.
b-b-b-but PINK HATS!
Who did she offend more: Muslims or Liberals?
We are going to MAKE FRANCE FRANCE AGAIN!
Why do leftists don't support her? Are they... Sexist!?!? REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
"Tell you what.  I'll wear this headscarf...if all the men in here wear fur suits.  I'm okay with role play if everybody is involved".
Fuck these douche bags.
I FUCKING LOVE HER 
Viva La Pen!
I hope she said "shove it up your ass" au Francais.
she may have just gotten a bump in the polls because of this. "Marine Le Pen Knows Exactly What She is Doing"- ITS RUBIO!
Best fucking march ever!
She's got a backbone, I'll say that.
Did they honestly bring it to her to make her put it on before continuing further?
I see no problem with this. Hope this works out for her in France, but I'm sure the global MSM will spin it to suit their own ends.  Imagine a strong France with a strong leader like this. 
It seems like it was just 4 years ago that feminism rightfully recognized Islam as being an oppressive belief system for women. What happened between then and now that shitlibs made Muslims the worlds largest victims ?   Edit: it's been on a steady trajectory since 9/11. My hypothesis is the more they attack us and our civilization the more sympathy they gain from shitlibs. The Charlie hebdo attacks got the ball rolling pretty heavily again. They seem to heavily believe in the Trudeau doctrine of "when you kill your enemies they win". 
Imagine if she told the men here how they should dress in her presence. That wouldn't go over well.
This is what the women's movement should be about.  Women are wearing headscarves because if they don't they can be raped and stoned to death in muslim countries, and now in many European countries.  Because basically Muslim men think women are subhuman.  So there is nothing cute about western women agreeing to wear a Muslim headscarf, if they do they are celebrating misogyny, female circumcision and pedophilia. 
Actual woman? check  Actually marching? check
She stands up for her principles. Compare this to the Swedish feminist politicians' visit to Iran.   Le Pen has courage, on the other hand the people at the Women's march joined the bandwagon of Trump bashing/hysteria, which requires no courage at all.

She is one of the very, very few female leaders I can respect and support, and I'm a woman. I hope she wins France's election. Kick some ass Le Pen!!!
*meanwhile in sweden...*  the same women who were trying to mock trump's executive orders as being a boys club...took a photo all wearing hijabs when meeting a muslim leader.  grow the proverbial pair, sweden!
This is what self-respect looks like. Everybody should have one.
Total badass
Please tell me video exist of this!! I love here.
WTF I love suppression of women now!  How dare she not respect their peaceful vibrant beautiful culture????!!!

I'm beginning to love this based woman ❤
Vive la France!
These pictures are hilarious.   First pic dude is explaining why she must wear the head scarf but it looks like Mrs. LePen just turns on her heel and leaves him in the middle of his explanation.  The guy on the right in the light blue shirt is funny too.   "Oooh no she di'int"
God bless this woman
This gives me so much hope!!!!! Long live Le Pen!!!!

So in order to protect her modesty, he avoids looking at her uncovered head, and stares at her tits.

As a faggot, I feel more safe and more secure knowing that Trump is our president as opposed to that globalist bitch Hillary Clinton. 
based lesbian here to say *fuck this so hard*  these sjw freaks are insufferable as hell and utterly blind to reality   also hi long time lurker first time poster but called this election for trump in september of 2015 i just don't post on reddit often but this made my blood boil   the willful blindness of people willing to buy into this hierarchization of oppression that only fucking succeeds in amplifying difference via said hierarchization have lost the goddamn plot. it's a disavowal of logic and "progress" which they all have such a crooked hard-on for. i often think about the past few years through a psychoanalytic lens, and the bitter narcissism and grandiosity of neoliberalism is astonishing to me.   there's no better metaphor for this entire election than lena dunham saying she wished she had an abortion so as not to oppress those who've had an abortion by speaking about it absent that experience.   neoliberalism is fucking münchausen syndrome i swear to god.   & THE UNDERPINNING LOGIC IS NIHILISM TO THE TUNE OF POLITICAL FATALITY. if neoliberal social justice warrior-ing justifies itself and its agents of legitimacy *SOLELY* through shared subjective experience via factors that, IF ONE ADHERES TO MATERIAL REALITY, cannot be altered, they fundamentally prohibit said subjective identification.  the *logical conclusion of social liberalism is that the egalitarian society they strive for is always-already futile because lest you share all the same subjective characteristics you are fucking locked out of identifying with someone else.* so fuck human empathy, right?! we're all selfish, racist, sexist bigots until we're sjw-splained into oblivion? it's madness, truly. it's a ticking time bomb strategy that assumes zero faith in the human condition. it's proselytizing with a cyanide tongue.   UGHHHHHH. i'm gonna buy a cookie.   /rant   edit: damn this blew up im so warm under all these gd coats

I have been told by multiple gay liberals that I am a traitor for voting Trump and that I should go kill myself. Part of why I have been disgusted by the LGBT community. The amount of selfishness is astounding. I am gay but that doesn't mean I agree with the bulk of what the LGBT community wants. I just want marriage but after that we can shut our faces. If a baker doesn't want to make be a cake, that is fine. They have that right to refuse me business but the lawsuits and attacks against those business owners is not alright. Sorry, going off on a rant. So many bad experiences with other gays >_< I know we are not all like that.
Same. That guy needs to take a step back from liberal news, which is almost 100% editorialized, and see what Trump has done for the gay community.   Just because he's not flaming, doesn't mean he doesn't represent your rights. People are so numb to that these days, if he's not spoon feeding people with his pro-gay standpoint, they think that means he hates them. He just knows that gay marriage is already legal and that it's time to move on with much more relevant fish to fry. 
You're gay, Trump doesn't care, you're welcome. 
[deleted]
NPR is fucking terrible and needs to be de-funded NOW...  
It's almost funny how frequently the president-elect is slandered as being homophobic. Not only is there zero evidence to support such nonsense, but he is by a very wide margin the most openly pro-LGBT candidate ever elected. He even outflanked the left on the whole NC bathroom issue and is friends with Caitlyn Jenner.   Unlike President Obama who was consistently and conveniently anti-marriage equality until *after* his 2012 reelection, unlike Hillary Clinton who opposed gay marriage for decades, and unlike the stodgy old social conservatives who stifled social progeess within the GOP for years, Trump has a long record of embracing the gay community.   It's almost like he's just a guy who respects people for who they are. Funny how that works.
Why would you say something so ignorant? Like come on dude, you have to be a special kind of asshole to use a tragedy to promote your political agenda. Real people (most in their early 20's) fucking died and it affected everyone here in Central Florida. Not just gays, but everyone including people who voted for Trump.
I'm a lesbo but I'm not scared... And to say it is more traumatic than that shooting is insulting. 
I am a gay drag queen and I support Trump! I switched sides BECAUSE of the Orlando shooting. 
I really don't understand the LGBTQ hatred for Donald Trump it makes literally no sense at all.
[deleted]
Trump's been pro-gay for nearly his entire life, spoke out against Don't Ask Don't Tell, and there are quotes dating back to the early 2000's where Trump says he hires the best people for jobs regardless of sexual orientation. Trump is the most Pro-Gay candidate to ever seek the presidency, and anyone who says otherwise is blind to the facts. People seem to forget that Obama wasn't Pro-Gay when he ran back in 2008. The alternative was Hillary Clinton, someone who accepts massive donations from Saudi Arabia, a country that executes gays by throwing them off rooftops.
I don't understand the LGBT deal with Trump.  I've never heard him say anything even slightly offensive or controversial regarding the gay community. 
HRC never represented me. A woman who advocates for the religion that would happily have me thrown off a building is ***NOT*** an ally of mine.
Yeah, the guy who is on record saying he has absolutely no plans to challenge anything about gay rights and the supreme court decision on marriage, the guy who was labeled an NYC moderate years ago, not nearly conservative or religious enough for mainstream republicans, the guy who held up the rainbow flag at a rally and who is on the record as having at WORST a live and let live attitude towards the gay community...   ...is more traumatic than a radical islamic terrorist with secret gay tendencies losing his fucking mind and murdering 49 people.   I really feel sorry for the soft brained democrats out there who ate up the propaganda that Trump is Adolf Hitler 2.0, they live in a mental prison of terror for absolutely no reason at all. For fuck's sake, Hillary Clinton is on video OPPOSING GAY RIGHTS. What the fuck do some people need to see before they wake up?
The first president ever **in American history** to proudly hold up the LGBT flag is "worse" than a terrorist literally murdering tons of people in a gay nightclub.  *Jesus... CHRIST...*
listen up liberals, cause you are so "tolerant" and "understanding":  -trump didnt win because of "white males" or "uneducated people", people from all demographics, male and female, white and black, and all ethnic backgrounds voted for trump.  so please, stop with the generalizations.  the modern conservative is not a bible thumping redneck, as much as you want people to believe that.  -you are entitled to an opinion, free speech is great.  however, you do NOT speak for everyone else.  stop speaking for other people.  how would you like it if someone did the same for you?  wouldn't you be annoyed or irritated?  -racism.  you are against racism as a liberal, right?  well, conservatives feel the same way.  so why do liberals feel it's ok to go on MTV and tell me why i'm a horrible person for being a white male?  no, fuck you for generalizing me.  discrimination based on skin color is...racism!  so if you think conservatives are "white, alt-right nazis and white nationalists" (a racist generalization, btw), why argue against racism when you practice it yourself?  im sick and tired of the left using double standards.  you cant be against racism and then generalize conservatives as being "white, uneducated bigots and sexists".  no, fuck you for assuming shit about me.  you don't know me, and you don't speak for me.  so either educate yourself, or kindly shut the fuck up.
I live in Orlando and have been to the club a few times, I'm also bisexual and this is just so not true. I really fucking fear how lightly the left take Islamic terrorism. I am probably equally as scared of their seemingly endless lies and corruption in their politics as a whole.  Having more then one party making sense would be good for america so I really hope the left sharpens up, they are on a really bad road. oh well. MAGAUSA 
I love BASED red pilled gays. MAGA 
Typical liberal shit logic. Anytime terrorists have committed a single act against the west, liberals will sink their teeth into anyone criticizing that group and give no shits about the actual victims. When Orlando got shot up, what did the liberals have to say? "Stop bigotry against Muslims!!!". Sorry, but, bigotry was delivered with every bullet fired into that club. RIP leftists.
[removed]
Nope, not me either. Doesn't speak for anybody. If he wants a Hillary presidency he can take his ugly ass over to Qatar, and fuck some of the goatfuckers, and then get thrown off a building for doing it. I'll be here in America enjoying my freedom under the first president who supports gay marriage going into office.
As a gay man, I know trump is better for me because less muslims that want me thrown off a building 
Of all the groups fearful of Trump, the LGBT are the one I least understand.  The dude has been in show business (pageants and the media) for 40 years.  He's as sympathetic of an ally as you could ever find for a 70 year old straight man.  He has pledged to protect the LGBT community from the Islamo-fascists that want to kill them.   
We're appropriating the left's constituents by offering those constituents real change, real progress, and real solutions to their problems. We fight equally as hard for gay rights as we do for religious freedom. They can coexist if we just follow the word of the constitution, ignore political correctness, and use common sense.  BIG TENT!
Worse than Orlando??? Delusional.  Also, gays aren't a hive mind. Different things make different people upset.
So over 50 people killed and 50+ injured some with wounds that will forever change their life and you could be more scared of Trump which has said at worst he is against gay marriage (just like Obama was when he ran and how Hillary was until this election).  The part i hate about the Left gay movement is their need to force themselves upon everyone else yet they are even by the best of polls they are 5% of the American population.
Years ago after the Bus Bombing in Britain, NPR shared the Palestinian position of that bus bombing saying "they had it coming to them".   I don't know what the Left stands for, but it's not our lives.
I support Trump and I love gay people. Honestly they are cooler than straight people at times. My god father is gay and he is one of the biggest role models in my life. Very passionate people. Very American. It just sucks to see that some have been misled by the dishonest media. 
Hiding my conservatism from my close family out of justified fear of being disowned is more stressful and traumatic than when attempts were being made on my life for being gay.  At least I knew who was against me then.
Same with my Jewish friends who've sworn off liberalism for good, when they kept hearing how Trump is "literally Hitler."  These are people whose families were ripped apart in the Holocaust, and who've seen what an actual dictator can do.  They get so fucking disgusted hearing privileged rich liberals using the tragedies they've experienced just for good boy points in the MSM.  Fuck these cunts who use mass murder for political gain.
This lib is completely oblivious, especially when you consider 30% of the alt-right is GAY.
NPR is at the forefront of fake news and always has been.  
This is proof of actual brainwashing. 
It feels like identity politics.   If you have any conservative views, people are quick to just assume that you must be some extreme right wing redneck.   Like if you say you want tighter immigration laws, they somehow take that as you being a racist and also somehow homophobic, Islamophobic, transphobic and basically anything else that conflicts with their ideology.   If you disagree on one point, they seem to assume you disagree on all points.     It goes both ways too, express a liberal opinion and some conservatives will lump you in with other "libtards" call for gun control and suddenly you're an SJW cuck who eats chicken tendies and weighs 400 pounds.   So because Trump is from the "republican party" he has to hold all the republican ideas, because muh identity politics. People will just assume things about him solely because of the party he is from

Why don't NPR ask the Orlando victim's families if they feel the same way
There's a lot of us who feel the same at r/rightwinglgbt
This is one of the biggest reasons why I support Trump. Even though I'm not gay I strongly support same sex marriage and Trump has shown a huge amount of support for the LGBTQ community.
Count me in. As a gay Asian guy living in SF, I feel much safer with Trump. Hopefully many of us still have the ability to think independently.
They don't speak for me either. Shame on all of them that would try to.

 Hey /u/tedandlisa123,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
This is an odd comment section, lots of downvotes and the first two comments are the exact same, anyone know what's going on? A brigade maybe?
If you're gay, why are you called tedandlisa123?
>To that homosexual who said that Donald Trump's election was more traumatic to gay people than the Orlando shooting  Did this actually happen?  What in the actual fuck.
Ignorant fucks like him are why Orlando happened.  Fuck this guy.
This is what happens when you demonize someone. The Left has constantly spread so many lies about Trump that they're starting to believe them. Fear mongering was their number one weapon, and all the lies and propaganda has clouded their vision making them believe Trump is the worst man to walk the Earth.   I guess it's just like the saying "you throw enough shit at the wall and some of its bound to stick".
My response to that is the same one I had to the Washington post pussy who published "comparing trump to hitler demeans hitler" (the writer was a jew by the way)....REALLY? DEMEANS HITLER?  either you're stupid or a liar. If you think a presidential election, democratically done makes the slaughter of tens of millions pale in comparison you're either an utter retard who should be fired on the spot and admitted for delusional thought or your boss should make you publish a follow up piece explain g how you lied and how you're sorry that you belittled the lives and memories of people's loved ones everywhere. There's no third option. Either a or b. You're either a complete idiot and honestly believe trump being elected is worse than  49 dead Americans or you're lying through your teeth and selling out your own demographic type for brownie points. Pick one, and because I'm kind I'll let you do the picking.  Edi: jew not new
I've never understood why some LGBT people are more upset over Christian Bakery cakes and Donald Trump then someone shooting them. @_@  If I was gay, I'd rather NOT be shot. :P
So the first Presidential candidate to not openly oppose gay marriage and waive the LBGT+ flag was more traumatic to gays than a Muslim gunning them down in a night club for being gay...  Alrighty then...
TBH, now I know what SJW's mean when they say "LITERALLY SHAKING"  Because I am so pissed and this made my stomach legit churn in disgust.  I honestly don't even know what to say I feel like fucking screaming. 
>DT's election was more traumatic than the Orlando shooting  I want to send this guy to Turkey.  I'm serious, I'll pay for his flight.  He must tell every single person he comes across that he likes men.  Let's see what Hilary Clinton's presidency would have done for him.
Admins must be sleeping because this is #1 /r/all right now
Get this man a rainbow colored coat!    P.s. No, social justice warriors, it's not so we can identify the gays in a crowd.
As a fagboi I agree 
Several months ago NPR stopped accepting public comments on their stories .  They said it was because they were getting too many rude and offensive comments which they couldn't control.  Of course now it is clear they did it to shield themselves from legitimate criticism of their hyperbolic fantasies .  In other words they gave themselves a safe space where they don't have to listen to the outside world.   
#WE HAVE THE BEST FAGGOTS
Someone actually claimed to feel that way? I'm offended, and I'm not a gay.
I'm honestly not surprised, considering a majority of my former fag friends wanted to vote for Hillary because she's a "take-no-shit, take-charge, head-bitch-in-control", which they would then follow with a litany of Trump "facts" learned from SNL skits and Entertainment Tonight.  Sorry, but voting Trump actually made me feel far more liberated than having to do a death march with the gay "community" by voting for Hillary.  I was really convinced I was going to have to go solo without any community at all because how their intolerance and tendency to ostracize anyone different is.. until there was The_Donald.
To the person that submitted this post, I salute you and I thank you. The spirit of this post is one and the same with the spirit that propelled the donald into the white house. Good day.

I dropped NPR a few months ago when they were doing a show with this Jewish dude who wanted to take his son to a bath house.  Anyway he finds two dudes fucking in the steam room at the gym and complains to the manager and the two people get banned and then they put up a sign that says "No sex in here" or something.  Then the dude goes full liberal guilt about it and can't even go back to the gym because he feels so bad.   What pissed me off most though was when he felt the need to defend himself by saying "I don't hate gay people, I'm practically a gay man stuck in a straight mans body... I love to cook wearing an apron and I love stage plays."  It pissed me off because it was like a microcosm of why I fucking hate the left.
We have the best LGBT friends, don't we folks?!
Please hear me out.   I used to live in Orlando. I had been to Pulse numerous times. What happened there was EXTREMELY traumatic. Was it surprising though? In scale, yes. In 2016, yes.   Let me play devil's advocate though, if you guys (and gals) will allow me to.   Gay nightclubs have a long, and relatively recent history of being raided and being involved in homophobic violence. There was the [Rainbow Lounge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Lounge_raid) raid in Fort Worth in 2009. This past year there was an upswing in attacks directed at homosexual men in the "gay" district of downtown Dallas. Depending on where you live, violence/harassment/discrimination is an expected reaction if people find out about your orientation. One of the biggest hopes from the LGBT population is not to be put on a pedestal or singled out to show off how "proud" they are in their daily lives (Pride Parades notwithstanding, a celebration of the progress made each year). Marriage was a big step towards that that normalization. Nobody wants to be stared at holding hands with their partner, or giving a kiss goodbye at the airport. The fact that more and more LGBT people were becoming more comfortable doing those things, regardless if they lived in a liberal or conservative town was a sign of progress.   Honestly, I'm not worried about Trump's position on gay people. I don't think he really gives a shit. The people around him, though, the people formulating his policies, such as Pence and other religious extremists in Congress, absolutely do. Will they be able to overturn Obergefell v Hodges? Probably not. Will they be able to overturn the various state laws that make it so employers can't fire employees based on their orientation? Yes. My state doesn't have that protection. I know my boss, and I know that's a small possibility, so I never talk about my personal life at work. Not a huge deal, but still kind of fucked up.    Perhaps I want to rent an apartment. They can repeal the protections that have been enacted that make it so sexual orientation is not a valid reason to deny someone a home or apartment. They can make it so a partner can't see their loved one in the hospital, or have parental rights over their child.   So short term, yes, the Orlando shooting was fucking traumatizing. But we move on, and we heal.   The stuff that this administration could do, the long term effects, will be a lot harder to get over in the long run.   Just my two cents.
Ctrl+F   LINK to interview: http://www.npr.org/2016/12/20/506337138/newspaper-editor-describes-struggle-to-heal-from-orlando-nightclub-shooting  Picture of guy, Billy Manes: http://www.supportwmfe.org/images/content/pagebuilder/ow_billy.jpg  >Host: Have you ever experienced anything like Pulse?   >BILLY MANES: Yes, I was shot at by BB guns when I was a 20.
They don't speak for me either.  The fake news is strong with this one.
We love our based MAGA gays
When Trump's administration starts dragging gays into the street and shooting them feel free to say this. (It wont, it never will)   When the right wing groups which have been "empowered" by Trump start dragging gays into the street and shooting them feel free to say this. (It won't happen, it never will)  What an unbelievably insane person. I hope they get the help they need and come to terms with reality.
Where the hell is this anti-gay thing coming from for Trump? Pence I can understand. Trump has never seemed to care one way or the other.
Did he say why?  There's only two things I can come up worn for a possible reason to consider Trump "anti-gay"  And that's Pence's history and the Supreme Court  But otherwise Trump has been pretty openly pro gay 
I am so, so tired of being told I have to hate someone for their lifestyle...I just don't care what people do with their private parts.  Everyone should be free to live their life how they choose - *life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness*.  Moreover, marriage supports stability!  Love!  How is that wrong?  I'm a straight guy from the south, and yes - it's awkward to answer my boy's questions about homosexuality.  But I welcome the conversation because I get to tell them that no one has the right to hate someone else for how they choose to live their lives.    So to those who are part of the LGBT community:  I will support you to my last, and to hell with those who tell me I should feel otherwise.
I had to turn his interview off after 3min listening to his bullshit. Fuck NPR, and fuck that guy right up his rainbow cum splattered sphincter. He should be ashamed for acting like he or any gay person is under any sort of threat during the next 8 years. Society as a whole has no problem with two dudes or two chicks kissing and banging.  He should fucking scared shitless of all the muslim extremists that want to throw his ass off buildings and eradicate him off the face of the earth.
So the 'NPR gay guy' (I heard the interview. They couldn't have found a more gay-confirming radio voice (Every...single...'S' was a 'th' and every...single...'O' was an 'oooooo.' It was almost like he had lip structure prolapse and was missing two front teeth, as well as both testicles since age 9.)) confirmed NPR's view of gay men:  hysterical pussies that are sobbing in their pillows at the thought of being rounded up by downlow CISHET redneck bullies, and gassed under Trumpenfuhrer anti-LGBT executive order 66. In fact in reality, if Hilldawg saw a political advantage in appealing to the worst kind of anti-gay violence (say, in a slightly altered universe where we have 100 million Muslims in-country) she would throw gay men so far under the fucking Jihadi-driven 20-ton lorry that the next generation would have no idea what 'gay' was in this country.
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST DEFUND NPR. Why the fuck are my tax dollars going to this piece of shit biased as fuck radio station.
You're more threatened by the President-elect who has stated he will not overturn gay marriage, who hoisted a rainbow flag at one of his events, who pledged to keep gay-hating Muslim extremists out of our country to prevent more anti-gay murders and who invited Caitlyn Jenner to use whatever bathroom he/she wanted at Trump Tower, than the terrorist who slaughtered dozens of gays out of pure hatred?  This is the level of fear mongering our media has foisted upon people who only get news from social media and biased news sources.  They're unhinged, because they only hear the most biased stuff that confirms their own beliefs and fears.
For me either!!
He does not speak for me either. You are not alone!!!

This is what these people do. They try to put everyone in a neat little box and label them. They still don't realize this kind of behavior is why they're losing. **They** are the bigots, **they** are the ones that are constantly othering people who step outside of the preset parameters that are meant to be attributed to them. If you're a homosexual or a minority or some other marginalized group, you're supposed to think this way, otherwise there's something wrong with you. Disgusting.

Shaq really is a fantastic role model for many people. He didn't use his physical attributes as a free ride like many athletes do, instead he used his abilities to further push himself. He contributes a TON to communities and actually is very intelligent. I can't remember what but he does have some degrees 
Ha!  They don't make barbells big enough.

I just posted this to the Cavs forum.  Just yesterday there was a post saying that Shumpert wouldn't go to a Trump white house......mind you there isn't supposed be be any political discussion.  When I pointed out that this is political discussion...I got downvoted and people said, "as long as the player talks about it it's OK"  Now let's see what they say about this.....somehow I think that their view on this will be different.
This almost makes up for "Steel" from 1997.

Shaq, like Trump, knows about winning.
Shaq confirmed as racist white nationalist. 
I don't care anymore what the rest of Reddit has to say. They are stuck up butthurt babies, and they've always been wrong about Trump. They preach about misinformation when they're the most misinformed people around! They will never give him a chance, good riddance!

Shaq is just another human who can think reasonable. Mad props 
Damn it, I fucking love Shaq. Someone get this patriot a coat!
Right though? How about letting him actually do something before declaring him to be literally hitlersatan?
What a racist 
In one of the articles I read he said he didn't have a lot to say about politics, but what he did try to keep bringing up was his work in getting legislation passed against drunk driving and getting proper training for police.  Apparently he's a part time officer in Florida? This guy is amazing
Shaq is amazing. Fame hasn't changed him one bit
**Shaq still doesn't crack, remarkable.**
My man. Always loved Shaq.
Welp, now we all know Shaq is a bigoted racist that hates Muslims. /s
Shaq is real, always liked the guy even when he and Kobe were feuding which caused the Lakers to implode after 2003.    He's a smart guy (made good business investments), but won't pretend like he knows something he doesn't like many celebrities walking around saying Trump will lock up the LGBT community and reinstate Crows laws.    Shaq is just 100% common sense with a little bit of an ego (less than he used to have). Kobe is kind of similar, I like them both despite Kobe kind of delaying the Laker's rebuilding process. 
"Shaq makes his case for Secretary of State".
A lot of what the left is angry about doesn't even represent Trump, he doesn't hate minorities or lgbt ppl so I don't know who this imaginary boogeyman is. I feel like people that are "scared" and saying "notmypresident" are referencing the types of comments on youtube and twitter that post actual racist things and happen to support Trump. i don't know how to tell them that Trump or Hillary, those people will always exist. 
Don't we have the best Shaqs folks?

Shaq's a cool dude, with a cool name. Smiles a lot too.
Tomorrow we'll hear that Shaq was forced into a mental assylum.
And now we shall forgive Shaq for Kazaam.
Instead of "as good as gold" we should now use "as good as goldbond" Trumps promises are as good as goldbond.
Nice of him to speak up, but I think it would be horribly hypocritical to praise a celebrity over their political opinions.  After RDJ and Cheadle piped up, I completely quit listening to celebs about shit that affects us plebs.

He owns a lot of businesses, he knows what it takes to be a successful businessman. He knows the difference between a jive talker and a businessman.

HOLY SHIT! In the final political debate in The Netherlands this man just called Mohammad a pedophile on LIVE TV!!! M A D M A N.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k8NCCki5rQ#t=7m52s  starts around 7:52  ---  ~~waiting for English subtitles but it's pretty clear what he's saying lmao~~  >''In the islam you have mohammed. Mohammed was a war-lord, as it is called, a warlord(but he uses different word now but same meaning). (he) was a pedophile. (he) Was somebody who beheaded jews in forests. (he) Was somebody who, in his mekka and medina time, very aggresive was. Is until this day, in contradiction to jesus, an inspiration to people along with allah. You know that last year with all those attacks in Germany and entire Europe, They all shouted ''allahu akbar'' before they slit the throat of priests in Paris. That is the islam. I dont have to tell you that mohammed isnt jesus right? And if we dont defend ourself from that, if we dont have the courage to see the islam for what it is, and it isnt only jihad, its islam itself who is making sure that if we are looking (politically) correct away, that we will soon as the netherlands and the free West will cease to exist. And we can never tolerate that.  ^thanks ^/u/infra_roodborstje!  
Damn that takes guts.
Just watched it live, cannot find a video link yet. He called Mohammad a warlord and a pedophile, incomparable to Jesus. (His opponent brought the values of Jesus up beforehand)
Holy shit... how are his polls looking? Is it close?   Not even Trump would dare say something that based. 
Damn how crazy is he for stating facts of reality on live TV! He should be hung!!
Yeah, I mean he did explicitly marry children, so... Thats kind of the definition. 
He is an absolute beast! We need this guy in our corner going forward
Isn't that grounds for jail time in the EU?
If the Dutch don't elect this man, they are officially cucked. Islam- OUT OUT OUT!!!!
The fact that it makes people uneasy is the whole problem. Cucks defend islam yet they're afraid what muslims will do if you say that Muhammed was a pedophile, or depict him. I don't understand how people can be so dense.
He has nothing to lose.  The "tolerant" ones from the Middle East have already said they will kill him, the treasonous locals in Holland with their globalist agenda will put him in prison, they backed him into a corner and he is not only coming out fighting but could get the KO win.  He has been fighting for his country for years, sometimes the only voice of reason there, the Dutch are in his debt.

I hope to God he wins, but holy fucking shit bless him for speaking straight.
I see someone already posted a correct translation while I was busy making this, but here is mine anyway.   In response to leader of Christen Union saying he is proud of the Christian tolerant culture the Netherlands historically had towards Muslims:   You know better than me that Jesus does not exist [as such] in islam. In islam there is Mohammad.   Mohammad was a 'warlord' [English], as it's called. A warlord [in Dutch]. He was a pedophile. He was someone who beheaded jews in the forrests. He was someone who, in his Mecca and Medina time, was very aggressive.   To this day he, in contrast to Jesus, inspires people, together with Allah. You know that last year with all the terror attacks in Germany and all of Europe. They all yelled "Allahu akbar" before slitting the throat of priests in Paris [probably meant in France].  That is islam. I don't have to tell you Mohammad is no Jesus. If we don't defend ourselves from that, if we do not dare to see islam for what it is.. And it's not only 'Jihad', it is islam itself that causes, if we keep looking away in a (politically) correct way, that we as the Netherlands and the free west soon won't exist anymore. And that we may never tolerate.  
Very courageous guy! Balls the size of Mecca.

He's not wrong.
I'm surprised they didn't bring up the fact that the bible instructs us to take in the refugee to our lands. Of course, it also states to not let in foreign gods. I think it's pretty clear, you can come here, but you can't come here believing in something that teaches you to kill.  I grew up in Iraq. The problem of Islam is simple. You can have a million Muslims. Most will believe the Koran. A percentage of them will kill because they believe what they believe. Islam teaches violence. Even Muslims believe that. There is no pussyfooting around that fact. All it takes is one faithful (if I can use the word) person and the killings begin.

I don't know if I've ever listened to Dutch like that. It's kind of fascinating how close it is to English for 3 words, then it sounds like someone spilled alphabit soup.
but saying you want to kill trump is socially acceptable. This timeline is going to right itself.
Why do all the new leaders coming up have balls of steel? I'm so proud! I hope the Dutch make the right choice. He has sooooo many more followers on twitter than his opponent also. I know that doesn't mean much but it's very interesting.

**#NOTMYPRECEDENT**
The truth of the matter is we like to have fun at reddits expense and reddits employees and user base  are all liberal pussies, that's why they don't like us, if they were in on the joke we'd be a default sub with the traffic we pull into this internet cuckshed.
I don't browse /r/all, so TIL that stickies *weren't* already blocked from /r/all sitewide. When they added the feature I just assumed there would have to be a caveat like that.
He's a fucking idiot and is out to get us just like any other SJW
It should have been /u/spez instead of Seth Rich but it fucking wasn't.
His narcissistic brain cannot stand having people who disagree with him on 'his platform'.   The real question will be, is he willing to burn down his city to prevent us from living there?
Reddit is suppose to be a place where communities can come together. Instead we are censored because he disagrees with us.  Fuck off /u/spez resign now
Fuck /u/ spez fucking nazi!!
U mad bro?
What an asshole?
And we use stickies for posting important news, rallies, and events.   How is that different from sports subs?  I wouldn't mind these rules as long as they were applied to everyone. 
They think they can stop our winning?   L O L
Woah, in that thread I only read madness, how much did you have to scroll down to find some sense?
we dont need sticky threads.  our narrative is whats sticky.  President Trump, our Dom, our movement...its always in their head.   They cant help it.  Soon they shall break and they too shall start winning. At that point we will give them their coat. 
 r/HillaryForPresident r/uncensorednews r/conspiracy 
I've just had an epiphany.....they're mad at us because we're beating them at their own game without any of tools and shady strategies they use.
I made a comment that completely got obliterated. Someone said that we're all bots and shitheads  (What a cuck) 
Fuck /u/spez
Is anyone really surprised? Reddit and the rest of social media has been trying to block our opinions all throughout this year.
Fuck /u/spez.
So I found out today that /u/spez is a pedophile.
Dang
Honestly, fuck /u/spez  I made a reddit account just to post here. You delete this subreddit and im following suit. 
Smell that lads? - THAT's pussy.
SPEZ.
**CUCK**
We will adapt young 'pede.
Is there some communist leader that /u/spez reminds you of?  Of yeah - every single one of them.  /u/spez is a coward.
establishment
Lmao they don't want to see the carrier deal in the example. It ruins their narrative of him being a megalomaniac toddler running for president for his own ego. DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REEEEEEEEEE /u/SPEZ HELP 
to be fair we were the top post of /r/all and everybody knew what he was making the filter for... us
he is a third wheel quite often from what i gather, his wife likes other dudes and he tags along like a leech 
Aaron would definitely be disappointed. I was an avid reddit user before this election, and its been sad seeing its steady decline in integrity.
*You have been banned from Spez-it.*
Don't they have to agree to it?
Is he unburnable to share holders? Only thing he'll listen too. 
Rekt son
u/spez likes little boys and his buddies at r/cannabalism

Lol petition, gotta hit the investors in their wallets to get change.   
They will always suppress us no matter where we go on this site
That would be so awesome if it did
Are those real subs? I'd click to see but i don't want that stuff on my computer.
Don't call us nimble navigators for nothing!
The best people in a culture/civilization/group always do, the rest die out slowly.
well if they do not agree we can use that money to host a new and better version and then spamn adds all over the world on t.v :P 
Only if they own a majority of stocks. If they don't own that much, then we could just buy up a majority of stocks in reddit, and then we own the company.
its a private corp
Can we make our own version of Reddit Gold?   Midas of MAGA... Or something not lame. 
Indeed.  I hear there is also a sub for pedophiles to commune; it is defended as a sexual orientation in some circles and some people believe if they can look at fake child porn or fantasize that their lust for children would be sated, I don't agree with that at all.  I don't know the name and I don't really want to.  I suppose I'd have to to tell the media.  God this year has been bittersweet.  So much winning, but so much darkness.

Legal immigrant from Spain, Army combat veteran, Army Ranger and the only Steeler that had the balls to be on the field during the anthem. Leave it to an immigrant who earned his citizenship to show those who are ungrateful the importance of being an American.

Watch the media call him a racist ableist xenophobic bigot

What a patriot. He would never hide his patriotism, no matter what the liberals will say about him. Maybe he can lead the rest of his team to stop being so cowardly. 
As a former Army Ranger he knows firsthand how lucky we all are to be Americans. I am so sad for my country.

The cunt who sang the national anthem for the titans seahawks game took a knee at the end of our national anthem...... wow, really...
Absolutely pathetic that not ONE other player had the balls to go out and stand with this man. Fuck the Steelers. 
It's pathetic.  Sports players think they are edgy political activists now.   Simultaneously the left says this place is a shithole, worth protesting and then say we are chaotic evil for wanting illegals out of it.
Trump wins again! Today was supposed to be the day the liberals/Dems/BLM thugs were going to teach Drumpf a lesson. Instead we have this ICONIC photo and a new American hero who will be the big story of the week if not longer. This man can write his own ticket.
Lol and they fucking lost. Like true fucking cucks
I stayed with Lions through the 0-16 season but today 7 pieces of trash kneeled for our anthem. Happy they lost in the worst way possible. America before everything else.
I was at the game.  The Steelers got boo'd bad when they came out right after the anthem.  The best part was the USA chant after every Bears score.
They think normies love BLM or something.  Normies give ZERO fucks about BLM OR they have a negative view of it because of riots and burning towns down.  If they think shoving this in front of the normal everyday americans every single game day is a recipe for success.  KEEP IT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  my old parents that don't know anything about this aren't even watching games any more because of it lololol.
Now that is a man who respects his country.
He served in the military   He knows what it means to protect that flag, unlike the other idiots
My grandpa fought in the Korean war as a marine at 18 years old. I'll never forget the 21-gun salute at his funeral after he passed.  He was a *huge* Steelers fan and if I could bring him back just for today, he'd think he was on another planet.
I am so thankful for Reddit and the Donald right now because I'm going to vent a little bit. I go on my Twitter and I see friends of mine people whom I really respect saying that they stand with Kaepernick and they stand with these people but not for the flag not for the Star-Spangled Banner our national anthem well I'm gonna tell you something my grandfather came here from Italy with nothing not only did he go to work and quit school in 4th grade  he became a citizen was spat on by "Americans" treated like complete garbage called him a whop and every other Italian slur that you could call him and you know what he went and joined the Army when World War II happened and he fought the Nazis he got blown up in a tank had his elbow blown off spent a year in and English hospital and before that had to play dead in a pile of dead bodies while Nazi surrounding him with bayonets on their guns and stabbed into the pile of bodies. He was awarded the Purple Heart but obviously suffered from what we would call PTSD now what really upsets me is that people have such disrespect for a flag that my family almost died for and so many others did die for this is the greatest country on earth always will be it's not perfect but there are things that we have nobody else has everyone in 2017 is awarded equal opportunity it's sad to say but even some minorities might have more opportunity because while I'll get denied access to school with a B+ grade someone who is of color will be. I'm absolutely disgusted with the disrespect to our flag you may not love America you may think that there are problems but goddamnit have a little bit a dignity have a little bit of respect for people that made the ultimate sacrifice   these are fucking millionaires what does kneeling for the flag the national anthem what does that do or you just don't like Donald Trump I think the tides are turning in this country if people are going to act so blatantly disrespectful it's almost time to just cut them out of your lives cut NFL out of my life and I'm from Boston and the patriots a fucking awesome but I'm a real patriot and I will always stand with the flag for the memory of my grandfather and everyone else who sacrificed for red white and blue! If it's lame to be a patriot then I want to be lame
The Pittsburgh Kneelers.  A disgrace to the steel workers who built that city.    
I roared through my house announcing his patriotism. MANLY. 
Pretty pathetic when they can take the kneelers back, but no one can show up in solidarity with a vet who's doing the right thing and not disrespecting the flag or his country. 
And his team lost for being cucks.
Steelers gonna need a second locker room for that dudes massive balls.
An interesting point to bring up is that the media is only showing pictures of these protests and there's a reason why.  The videos, which are hard to find, will show that the crowds seem to be booing.  [example](https://youtu.be/MGGDxjq-IUI?t=2m25s)
in the past, protesters wore lots of flag and rw&b to protest in. they loved america, and they made it clear what they specifically didnt like about it and wanted to change.  you dont hate the nation itself while throwing a tantrum. there is no perspective there. people barely even know what you are fighting anymore.
Lifelong Steelers fan here. Canceled plans to attend game in Oct and am not watching today's game vs the Bears. 
Goodell decided to play the political virtue signaling game.  He's gonna pay for it. 
So proud if Villanueva. The rest of the Steelers just lost this fan, though. I'm so disappointed...I always thought that we would stay above the fray, not get involved, stay focused on the game. Instead they did the one thing more insulting than kneeling for the anthem - the pussies couldn't even show their fucking faces.  Not my team. Not anymore.
I'm not even American but that guy is inspiring as fuck.
make america great again..we are trump supporter.
We have the best Veterans don't we folks!!!
they hid because of what trump said? that is pretty ridiculous 
Anyone else bothered by how easily the left have fooled people into kneeling into submission in politics while at the same time convincing them somehow that Trump is a dictator even when there's evidence in plain site that there's no such thing! The left could sell these idiots bottled sea water and tell them it's better than fresh water to drink.
Fuck the NFL. NCAA players stand for the anthem.
Fans were booing the Bills & Broncos today for taking a knee.  The American people are done with this shit
 And my Bears all stood. And then we beat the Steelers' ass!
The Steelers did this at Soldier Field! A Stadium named in honor of soldiers that had died in battle! SAD!
White liberals are the scum of America 
GET THIS PATRIOT A COAT
This guy deserves a handshake from Trump himself
I have so much respect for that man! Served his country (received bronze star as well) and did what none of his other teammates would do: Respect our country and our flag! 🇺🇸 
NFL = No Fans Left
Protesting at your job, on your boss's job site, over politics or anything else, is not protected by amendment.     Public parks and such ARE covered.
I heard that the Bears had no kneelers. And the Bears beat the hide in the tunnel Steelers. REEEEEEEEE
You mean to say that, save this dude, the **whole fucking team** didn't even show up on the field?  That's pathetic.
Yeah, fuck the steelers, broncos, and any other shitty team that lets their players kneel.  As if Colin ruining his career wasnt enough of an example as to why we keep entertainment and politics seperate.   
Alejandro with the spirit of america in his heart.
Life long Steeler fan. Disappointed.  Stay tuned as I will be burning my Terrible Towels. 
The increased display of America-bashing asshole millionaires led to me cancelling cable TV service today. Fuck em.
He also was a Ranger who served three tours overseas! 🇺🇸
As a Pittsburgher I am proud to say this man is representing us, but I'm not proud of the rest of the team. He is my new favorite Steeler.
I swear if any of my cowboys do it I'm done with them and can almost guarantee Jerry will rip their ass. I bet he won't stand for that shit.   I can't find anything on it. Have any cowboys done it?
Judging by how there’s a giant camera stuck right in front of his face, I’m guessing it’s now controversial to STAND for the anthem.
Would ya look at that. In this picture there are many different races standing up. It's not making a statement to kneel, it's showing you have it too good that a flag offends you
Much respect to that hero. Fuck the Pittsburgh Kneelers
they lost that game. if they can't even be a team united on honoring our country, how are they going to be a team on the field? answer: they can't. they lost to a team in last place
True fucking Patriot. *salute*
God bless this guy, but seriously fuck the NFL. I don't care if I ever watch another snap ever again. I am done. 
This patriotic post is being censored from r/all. Fuck spez and this un-American website
It only takes one great American to overcome millions of cowards! Thank you President Trump! Thank you Alejandro! 
Having the Steelers stay in the locker room was just RETARDED optics. All you had to do is tell the one cuck that wanted to sit down to stay in the locker room. Now you dragged the entire team into looking like they were protesting. Art Rooney II is a fucking MORON for that shit. Now Tomlin's cucked ass is going off and spewing his soundbites of leftist talking points. Watch his dumbass postgame interview. He's a fucking idiot. If you don't want to be dragged into politics, stop virtue signaling leftist propaganda points. So disappointed in this shit and my team.  I will not say that Mike Tomlin is one of the most pathetic fucking "coaches' that has ever existed and that I hope his dumb ass is out of town yesterday. That's not nice so I will not say that. I would  also never tell you to stream the NFL's shit so they don't make money, so I am not going to say that. Please it would be awful if football fans simply watched the games through illegal means. DO NOT DO THAT!  
As a Steeler fan, this breaks my heart that he was the only one to actually, you know, pay respect to his country.
I heard keeping the steelers in the locker room was a team-administration decision. Like "we're not going to tell our players not to kneel. But we will tell everyone to stay in."  I think it was smart, if true 
I read somewhere that players used to come out after the national anthem. Is this true?
And the Steelers lost to the Bears. Focus on non-sense and don't worry about your job and see what happens. 
I'm torn between wanting to buy his jersey and not wanting to support a team that allows their players to act in this way.
Now that's...a man.  Woof!
This pic made my Dad smile today. He went to Ranger School and then was an advisor in Vietnam 68 to 69.  Not standing for the anthem is so disrespectful to him, other vets, those that did not return and their families. At least someone had the balls to stand. Proud it was a Ranger. So done with the NFL right now.
I said it once, I'll say it again, the owners are going to issue a directive by Thanksgiving or no one is going to watch the Super Bowl. They are already having trouble finding a singer. Do you know how much money is spent on that game alone?? 
He just made a new fan in me.  
Much respect to this REAL man !
 I don’t watch NFL anymore, it’s garbage. I don’t want to contribute to the paychecks of thugs and women beaters. 
I’m sorry, but him walking out *alone* (in direct defiance of what his coach and teammates dictated) is the single most patriotic thing I can imagine.   This is a guy who *served* his country. He knows America is exceptional and he knows the sacrifices made so that the flag can fly and that you can play football for “fun.”  You sit for the pledge? That’s great. Stop cashing your American checks and spending greenbacks while you’re at it, you bag of shit hypocrites. 
I am not a fan of the steelers as a team, but this man deserves recognition for being a shining example to todays youth!
NFL isn't even entertaining anymore. The one thing I wanted politics out of...now that's tainted and maybe forever. Im done watching the NFL. I have better things to do with my Sunday. 
A real man and patriot.
Steeler fan here, I'm ashamed of my team.  I hope the fans make it clear this was beyond unnaceptable.
Imagine being the only one that did stand now that's courage 
Wow... this post almost getting 20k. On a sequestered sub. I think you might have a problem NFL.
Steelers handled this whole thing extremely poorly.  Keep the whole team in the locker room to "avoid the controversy"....but you can't force an Army vet to stay in the locker room without it looking really bad...so they let him come out.  Now whatever the other players do it doesn't actually avoid the controversy, and whoever doesn't come out to join is implied to be "protesting" whatever it is they're claiming to protest.                              So instead of 4-5 guys looking like douchebags, it's the entire team except for one guy.  Deeeerp good job Steelers.
RANGERS LEAD THE WAY.
The rest of the Steelers LITERALLY hid from the National Anthem. What a fucking joke.   Kudos to Villanueva!!
The rest were told to hide in the back of the bus.  
Globalists owners of our baller sports operations embrace the anti-USA narrative of the DNC.  George Soros funds the BLM and the BLM infects the NFL/NBA. Soros is the Black entertainer's new puppeteer.   
BASED FUCKING PATRIOT! I'd like to see these cucks come face to face with former veterans who were prepared to die (some as young as 18) for the freedom and prosperity of America and its allies. I wish I had the privilege of being American - they don't know how good they've got it.  SAD!
Literally the only one of the whole team that isn't a piece of shit. Good on ya, Alejandro Villanueva.
Had to upvote!!!! #MAGA
went to a colts and browns game today and half the browns kneeled and the whole damn stadium booed em. funniest shit ever
Ashamed to be a Steeler fan today. This shit wouldnt have happened if Dan Rooney was still alive.
I am so disappointed with the Steelers.
> In Chicago, the Pittsburgh Steelers stayed in the tunnel except for one player, Army veteran Alejandro Villanueva, who stood outside with a hand over his heart.   
Even the piece of shit coach didn't want him out there. They argue they want their guys to show what they believe in. Make up your mind.  http://dailycaller.com/2017/09/24/steelers-coach-didnt-want-army-vet-to-stand-for-anthem-video/?utm_campaign=thedcmainpage&utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=Social
As someone you all would call "racist" or other buzzwords, I think this is a class issue, not racial. Notice the working class black honoring the flag, while the millionaire blacks are in the locker room.
Aren't we supposed to hate hispanics and be all white supremacists here? There are 4-5 threads on Villanueva in the font page alone.  Get it right, snowflakes. We don't care about background, creed, or gender (of which there are only two). We care about science, facts, small government, less taxes, and patriotism.

So I see our upvotes are still being censored. Nice to see Reddit hasn't changed.
What the fuck? Obama just ignored the fact that the guy declared allegiance to ISIS. "we don't have an idea as to his motivation or inspiration" are you kidding me?
Arabic man kills people - Still not ok to assume terrorism  Reports of wearing a suicide vest - Still not ok to assume terrorism  Publicly swears allegiance to Isis - Still not ok to assume terrorism  Beats man to death with Koran while shouting allahu snackbar - Still not ok to assume terrorism  Waving Isis flag and burning coptic christians to death while forcing women into sex slavery - still not ok to assume terrorism   Basically, if SJW's ignore radical islam long enough they think it'll just disappear.
But it had nothing to do with Islam right? # FUCKING WRONG
Trumps plan on not letting muslims in is common sense. Islam is not compatible with the west.
Is it still Islamophobia if time and again it's Muslims committing these acts?  Oh wait. We're in a SJW country. Duh, of course it is.

MSNBC right now talking about how Obama is going to make the vocal point on his speech being about guns.  Fucking Christ, it's a terrorist attack.  I've never seen a leader before so heavily blatantly ignore the main issue at play.
#There it is.
THIS IS CONFIRMATION  IT IS AN ACT OF ISLAMIST JIHADISM  POST AND TWEET ROBERT SPENCER EVERYWHERE IT'S A WAR ON THEOCRATIC FASCISM
Obama and the media is still going to blame it on the gun and how more gun control could have prevented this. Guarantee it. 
"Religion of peace"
Obama is 10 mins late to his press conference, this just leaked... Coincidence???

The quickest damn sticky this sub has seen yet
This shooting is going to win Trump the election 
Obama is spinning this as another gun control issue. The suspect was a licensed security guard. No word of Islam. WTF.
#Treason!
I dont know. We still cant be too sure that this was a terrorist attack.

Well, that answers [that](http://news3lv.com/news/nation-world/isis-kill-list-targets-palm-beach-treasure-coast-residents-ex-fbi-agent). He was an agent of ISIS, they indicated more attacks coming in FL, too. Super.
The news will probably wait as long as possible to release that recording. But they will eventually have to.

This will make the spin difficult.  Good luck, liberal media.
This is honestly shocking. I was under the impression that Islam is the religion of peace and understanding for people from all walks of life. I just cannot understand how someone so open minded and understanding can commit such a crime. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the news today. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fuck would someone that has been raised to be peaceful and accepting of infidels do this? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Bernie to be president and fix this broken country. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought the religion of peace is just that - peaceful.
A shocking revelation to nobody. Except for CNN and /r/News's mods, obviously.
Ahem, religion of peace! /s

#BUT I WAS TOLD IT WASNT ISLAM
But will President Barack Hussein Obama II mention this when he gives his news conference later?  Will he mention that Mateen was shouting Allah Akbar while he was spraying bullets at Police? 
Why does it say only 1 point,  did the reddit admins remove upvotes again? 
Fox just reported on this so despite this voting shit the word is still getting out.
I work nights and I can't sleep.  I told you this morning - there was no hiding this.  There's no spinning this.  As a 30 year old gay man, my only thought is that if I were younger and/or DADT hadn't been around when I thought about it at that younger age, I would be headed down to the recruitment center right fucking now.  I hope our armed forces start painting rainbows on the missiles and bombs that turn these evil fucks into dust.  Edit: Just noticed I'm one of 5,000 new Nimble Navigators in the last eight hours.  That's a statistic I'm fucking proud of.  Proud and god damn fed up.

And of course, everyone hops on the "ban assault rifles" train.   When a man gets drunk and and rapes a woman, you *don't blame the alcohol.*  When a man buys an assault rifle and then swears allegiance to the Islamic State before murdering 50+ gay Americans, you **shouldn't** blame guns.   Ban the ideology, not the tool. Get woke, America.
Obama: Muslims built the very fabric of this nation! They are a religion of peace!
Boom bada boom.

And there you have it. ..
Only Trump can save our planet! We should build a wall around all muslim homes in the US. No more problems then!!
The media is trying hard to spin this as someone who was inspired by ISIS, but let's not forget that ISIS has been encouraging potential foreign fighters that want to travel to Iraq/Syria to instead carry out attacks in their home country. These guys are 100% loyal to ISIS and ready to die for their cause. 
NOT ALL MUSLIMS!!   Right guys? Like, this guy must be some kind of extremist and moderate Muslims will surely disavow him since this goes completely against the religion of peace, right? 
Not subbed here but may be after all this...  I used to think you guys were annoying as fuck because all I wanted to do was browse reddit and your posts seem to be dominating r/all  Now...now its for a good reason, and I fully supportive now.   edit: I'm

Voted for Bernie. I couldn't vote for Trump but I did knowingly throw away my vote and essentially help trump by voting for stein. Husband did the same. There was no chance in hell that I would vote for Hillary. I couldn't do it. I knew what it meant and so be it. I couldn't vote trump but I did the best I could do.   Edit: now she better go to jail.

I'm a 30 year old Michigan man.   Hillary Clinton should never have been the Democratic nominee. She never had any real shot of winning. This is evidenced by the fact that she lost the election in a landslide. She was absolutely crushed in the Electoral College. The ivory tower elites at the DNC manipulated and orchestrated a situation where Bernie never had any possibility of getting the nomination – despite the fact that Bernie was the only one who was consistently shown to have a strong chance of stopping Trump. Alas for the liberals that their supreme arrogance was their own undoing. The DNC presumed to own the will of the American people – of the American Democrat. The DNC attempted to play ‘God’ by ushering in the Age of Hillary against the will of the people because it was “her turn.” Her campaign message was essentially, “Hey, it’s my turn now!” Well, that’s not how America works. That has never been how it works. It will never be how it works. She never had any merit and her “credentials” where actually a huge liability in a time and place where the little people were simply fed up with the federal government and its major failings under the Obama Administration.  Hillary failed to maintain the Obama coalition. She failed to mobilize African  American voters; she failed to marshal the Latino vote; she even failed to muster the might of the female voter. She just straight up failed across the board. What I’m about to say is actually incredibly important. Democrats went out and voted against Trump – they didn’t vote for Hillary. Republicans and Independents went out and voted Trump – they didn’t vote “against Hillary.” There was a Trump Train – a Trump Movement. A lot of us boarded it a long time ago. For me, it was during the primaries and I’ve been a passenger on the Train ever since. There was no Hillary movement. No one actually liked or likes (Or has ever liked) Hillary Clinton. For them, it was more about defeating Trump than it was about electing Hillary. That is a major reason why you lost.   It’s actually quite remarkable how well Trump did in the female vote. I understand that a lot of people wanted Hillary to win and “shatter the ultimate glass ceiling.” They are utterly devastated now. They were crying tears of despair at Hillary HQ. This isn’t an indicator that America isn’t ready to vote for a woman. It doesn’t demonstrably suggest that America is sexist or that men are not ready to give up the reins of power. It simply means that America wasn’t prepared to elect the most corrupt woman who was probably born in any time period, anywhere throughout the annals of history.  The lame stream media did their best to destroy Trump. Boy, did they do their best. Incessant, around-the-clock attacks, phony charges of sexual assault, and the infamous “grab them by the pussy” remark. The thing of it is that most people, in all reality, didn’t care about the “grab them by the pussy” remark. Newsflash: men (and women) think about sex nearly constantly. Men want to fuck women and vice-versa. It’s in our programming. Men lust for women; women desire men. It’s how the world keeps turning. It’s intuitively obvious to anyone who possesses even a scintilla of intelligence that Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” remark was merely locker-room banter. If you think that comment is bad, you obviously don’t live in the real world because the things said in locker-rooms, factories, restaurants, shops, stores, bars, etc. is far worse.   The lame stream media, Obama, and Hillary all tried to demonize normal, law abiding white males. We are the basket of deplorables. However, in doing so, they alienated and galvanized us. It pissed off a lot of people. Obama has done more to polarize this nation than any President in history. He hasn’t supported our men and women in blue, he hasn’t supported the border patrol agents, he hasn’t supported the FBI. He hasn’t supported the military. He makes apologies to the rest of the world for America. Why would we apologize for being the greatest country to ever exist in the history of homo sapiens? In written history, there has never been a nation like America. We put Armstrong on the lunar surface on 20 July, 1969. Two Americans named the Wright Brothers pioneered and invented the airplane and made their first successful flight on 17 December 1903. We invented the Internet, the transistor; Bell Labs and later Intel have pushed processor technology to levels never even imagined. We will experience the Technological Singularity largely as a result of American genius and imagination. We dream big. We don’t think in terms of what is impossible. There is no upper ceiling to our potential; it’s literally infinite.  Race relations are at an all-time low and the perception is that it’s all the fault of the white man. Look at Ferguson. Look at Charlotte. Look at Bodymore, Murdaland, I mean Baltimore, Maryland. Look at the lunatics out in force right now burning the American Flag and screaming in protest of Trump as we speak. Look at Saginaw; look at Detroit; look at Flint. People fucking hate each other. The Internet (social media, reddit, video games, and other discussion forums) are filled with more vitriol and animosity than you could possibly imagine. You would have thought Obama would improve the relationship between black and white people. He hasn’t. I would love nothing more than a world free of prejudices against people of color and people with pallor. However, that world wasn’t coming to fruition. That dream wasn’t becoming real. In fact, the issues were exacerbated by a President who never truly was a leader.  Trump was covered twenty four hours a day and seven days a week by the likes of the Clinton News Network (probably doomed in light of this election and the new WikiLeaks DNC emails that prove collusion/corruption – R.I.P. Wolf Blitzer’s career), MSNBC, Huffpost, the #failingNYTimes, and other proprietors of fictional narratives.  People seem to still be laboring under the delusion that political correctness is a necessary function and that we all need to talk a certain way to avoid offending or alienating people. The idea that political correctness is obligatory was just shattered. The American people wielded a sledgehammer and just shattered the political correctness like Gallagher shattered watermelons. We defied the status quo; we defied the establishment; we defied the corruption. Liberals attacked Trump’s blunt method of talking. Why not speak in simple terms, and most importantly, speak the truth? There is a nobility in speaking in frank, ordinary terms.   The polls. Oh my, the polls. The polls, rigged in Clinton’s favor. They all predicted a Clinton landslide. RealClearPolitics, Nate Silver from Five Thirty Eight, CNN – they were all wrong. The experts and gurus didn’t quite earn their salt now did they? They have one function; they have one job. The job is to accurately poll. They failed and thus are utterly worthless. They tried to dispirit and demoralize the Trump Train. They could not have been more wrong. It was Trump who won in a landslide, historic election – not the other way around. I have never, in my life, been so excited to vote in an election. I have never been more proud to vote for someone. I have never been more proud than I am now to have been part of the Trump Train in this time and place. The corrupt curtain is about to be peeled back to reveal an overabundant ugliness. But that ugliness will soon be put to rest. To quote Qyburn from ‘Game of Thrones’, “Sometimes, before the new can be ushered in, the old must be put to rest.   The corruption in Washington is about to be put to rest. The people have restored sanity to this country. We won. And I will help build the W A L L. I can’t wait! The Mitten went red and I am so proud of the people of the Great State of Michigan! I crack a beer now in your honor.  Good night! Good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say goodnight till it be morrow. 
God Bless America

I'll be honest, was getting a little concerned that it took til Wednesday for us to officially win Michigan this week, the last two weeks we won it on Monday.
I'm confused, is this the recount it the votes being certified? It feels like he has won Michigan numerous times.
[deleted]
I think Bernie can still win this.
Fuck Stein, Fuck Hillary and Fuck Soros. This officially stops any chance Hillary had. (She didn't have one)
I've lost track of how many times we've won
Jill Stein is saying on her FB live chat that "Donald Trump and his cronies" are challenging her recount efforts because he is scared that it will reveal he rigged the election and that Hillary actually won. Trump should sue her for slander.
#I CANT TAKE ALL THIS WINNING
Okay what dirty trick will Stein pull out of her ass now?
WEEKLY MICHIGAN WIN! WE NEVER GET TIRED OF WINNING MICHIGAN!
I feel like we win Michigan every Wednesday 
http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/federal-judge-ends-michigan-presidential-recount  We did it! 
From the Time article about being person of the year -- it encapsulates why he won it (x amount of times)  >“I hoped for change and never saw it,” Mengel says of the Obama years. “I watched jobs go away, and any jobs that came in were at McDonald’s. I’m not knocking McDonald’s, but it’s a starter job. It doesn’t make the car or house payments.” When a friend bought him a MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN hat this year, Mengel took to wearing it everywhere he went. He never believed the polls that said Hillary Clinton would carry **Michigan**, because he can’t remember ever sitting down with a group of five or six people and finding more than one for her. “Hillary came along and she just never said what she was going to do,” Mengel explains. “She just talked bad about Trump.”  - Wasn't racist; voted for Obama twice who ran on the same stuff about hope and change and bringing jobs back   - didnt see it happen  - hillary talked shit about trump instead of saying that she too would bring back jobs.  
What the fuck is this, **GROUNDHOG DAY?!**  Each day I wake up it's the exact same story, I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in a perfect dream;  **Trump wins on jobs!**   **Trump wins on the economy!!**    **Trump wins on his cabinet picks!!**    **Trump wins a state for the 3rd time in a week!!**    Still not tired of winning Mr Krabs!!
Let's see, to start off, there was no evidence on any hacking or wrongdoing of any kind, Hillary was not contesting it, Jill had no chance in hell of winning even 5% of the vote, and a recount would change absolutely none of that, but would waste time and resources.  Sorry Jill, you don't get to have a recount just because you didn't like the results, ya dried up cunt!
Good Evening, Judge Goldsmith just lifted the Temporary Restraining Order from the Michigan Recount. The federal decision coupled with the Michigan Court of Appeals decision and the Board of Canvassers directive to the Michigan Elections Director to end the recount makes this recount officially over. Thank you especially to the thousands of people who volunteered during this recount. You should all be extremely proud of what we accomplished together! Please note: You DO NOT need to report to your recount location tomorrow.  This is a victory for the taxpayers and voters of Michigan who can be assured that their vote will count when the state’s electors meet on December 19th. The courts have affirmed the stance the campaign has maintained from day one: Jill Stein, who received only 1.07% of the vote in Michigan, is not legally entitled to hijack the will of voters and drag them into an arduous and expensive publicity stunt. Jill Stein’s 1% temper tantrum cost Michigan taxpayers millions of dollars and would have cost them additional millions of dollars if not for the actions of President-elect Trump, the Michigan Republican Party, and Attorney General Bill Schuette. I imagine many of you are as exhausted as I am. Please get some much needed and deserved rest if you can. Thank you all, Ronna Romney McDaniel Chairman, Michigan Republican Party
Debased Plant Lady and Crooked Hillary need to be charged and prosecuted for fraud and collusion for this.
LMAO as soon as voter fraud for Hillary surfaces they shut it down

Stein knows Trump won handily; She just wants to de-legitimize the Democratic party further by further emphasizing their loss and denial, while soaking up soft dem supporters and others from the left and money leftover from the recount funds. It's actually a redpill disguised as petitions. It'll be interesting to see what the party loyal democrats do once they wake up(from the pain of losing repeatedly) and realize this, but by then I think it'll be too late.

Why is a 14 year old boy CEO of reddit?

TRUMP FOR REDDIT CEO!
Can confirm, Am uptrumping everything I see in New and Rising now.
Soo spicy.  Soo delicious.
That is embarrassing.  Maybe he will sell Reddit to CNN.
You should shop the face of king cuck spez onto the photo.
# Top Kek!
An agree of yuge proportions.
Memed right into the Oval Office.
My god he is one ugly creature.
That's what they want, they're cucks remember?
I'm  still confused  why spez loves his pedo friendly stuff  but hates T_D.    ( not really )
U/SPEZ IS A FUCKTARDEDCUCKHEAD
He looks like such a wuss. He looks like someone I would never be associated with in the real world because he's slimy and would stab your back! What a CUCK!
SPEZ.
I found the ability to diffuse to be sorely lacking.  **Anyone else?**
He forgot the golden rule of fighting the trolls....  #**DON'T FEED THE TROLLS!!**
I just upvoted everything on front page. Next I'll go to NEW and upvote everything there.   Stupid Cuck - damn straight.
HOLY SHIT WHAT A CUCK LOL
They banned us from every other sub caging us into this echoe chamber making us stronger. Everything the left tries backfires.
He is the Starcuck of teh Internet and must be fought against by all of humanity, because humanity is the freedom to speak if nothing else  https://imgur.com/a/IysL9
How old is this guy?  He looks like he's 12 and acts like it too!!
Fuck /u/spez  Kiddy porn get you off? Why else would you delete pizzagate and allow pro-pedo subs?  
This is why everyone is sick of the intolerant SJW movement. It's intransigent, creating more fights (often for no reason) and resentment than it diffuses.
I'm starting to think you guys don't like /u/spez... 🤔
HAHAHA awesome
This subreddit is turning into r/pyongyang
They're not sending their best, but that's ok we'll use them anyway.

This picture was taken right as his "friend" finished on his girlfriend.
I'm still amazed by all of this, /u/spez alters users' posts, apologizes, then censors /r/the_donald because...potato.   It's like he's having some kind of a meltdown and thinks he can control life, but he can't...no one can. The universe has a way of kicking you in the ass when you think you're in control. As we've seen, ignoring, insulting, then censoring the silent majority has led to a HUGE backlash. Ask Hillary.  This will be no different. 
Lmaooo I always thought spez looked like bad luck brian!
I couldn't care less when people harass poor little spez. He deserves everything that is coming to him
Every time he tries we get stronger!
Seriously. I wasn't upvoting that much, but right now i'm upvoting EVERYTHING! 
#based classic shitposting
Thanks to all the useful idiots who made MAGA possible. 
Calling him a CEO is like calling a hotdog stands grill person a CEO.  The guy is far from a corporate executive officer.  He's bad at everything he does, no one likes him, and he inherited the entire structure of this site (as in, had pretty much nothing to do with its growth).  If I was working for a popular little site doing some coding and whatever else they pretend to do, I'd be fucking livid to work next to that guy.  Comes off as the kind of person that will take credit for your ideas behind your back.
Spez is an idiot
thanks u/spez/
The Donald gets a zenkai boost when Reddit tries to censor it.
This extra SPICY one will be here for generations to come.
There are very few men who can pull off the plaid vest over a buttoned-to-the-top polo. GodDAMN. 
So I want to point out that this is the sort of behavior that is against reddit ToS and *will* result in our sub being banned.  I mean, have you guys *read* the ToS?  This sub is absolutely gonna get banned and you're all going to be pissed and scream about /u/spez censoring us when, in reality, it was the fact that we couldn't stop violating the ToS (which predate the_Donald, by the way.)  I love our God emperor as much as anyone else... *and that's why I'd like to continue having a place to discuss him.*  So can we cut the shit please?   Seriously, if you haven't read it...  > **You agree not to interrupt the serving of reddit**, introduce malicious code onto reddit, make it difficult for anyone else to use reddit due to your actions, **attempt to manipulate votes or reddit’s systems, or assist anyone in misusing reddit in any way**. It takes a lot of work to maintain reddit. Be cool.  There's no way the argument can be made that this behavior isn't against the ToS... So can we cut it out before we get our sub banned?  Please? 
When I first saw his picture I imagined it on that meme (The retard smiling kid), glad someone made it.

Holy shit that trains going fast
"I just really dont have the inclination to take u/spez's job at such a young age"
#Holy shit. Spez just came into my room to bring me his wife to fuck and I literally screamed at him and hit the lube out of his hands. He started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on him. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to the CEO of "The Reddit" but I'm literally in shock that he is a pedophile. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is Spez both a cannibal and a pedophile? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the Elites eat people and rape children. I want a Reddit I can believe in. I want Tucker Carlson to be Reddit's CEO. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought Reddit admits were fair and balanced???? This is so fucked.
We Don’t Like Her Ideas, But Do Not Wish Her Harm. We Wish RBG A Good Recovery And Retirement To Heal.
My grandmother fell at 86 and has been doing well with recovery. Hip replacement. She put on good weight and started eating better because of it.
The news cycle this week,   #WOW
After a fall at this age it’s usually a pretty quick decline. Sad.
I agree, even though we would like another SC justice this not the way we want it
Ruth was already having trouble walking and standing, and now she has fallen. I think she might have polyneuropathy. If true, then she will need a wheelchair to prevent further falls.  I wish her a fast recovery.
[deleted]
Paging Amy Cony Barrett
I would love her to enjoy a long healthy retirement.  Live life Ruth!
Jesus.. Three broken ribs? Where did she fall from?  Edit: She's a tough lady. Didn't go to the hospital right away. Waited until the next morning to go to the hospital. Get well soon!
I WISH HER WELL  BUT SHE NEEDS TO RETIRE! shes playing twister with the reaper
I hope she’s ok and recovers.  It’s time for her to step down.
I pray she can come to a full recovery and enjoy her retirement 🙏
She should retire and try to enjoy the time she has left. There's no good reason for her to stay on the court at her age just to be in the minority ruling losing over and over on each case that comes before them.
Time to call it a career and enjoy the time she has left 
Libs are having a panic attack right now
Thanks for posting this!  Hopefully the idiots in other subs don’t pull the “ The Donald wants her to die!!! They are stickying her dying !!!! FUCKINGNNAZIS”
I don't agree with her, but I would prefer her intelligent discussion to the drone of the mob. She won't recover well from broken ribs at her age.   Shes done her duty to the country. We should celebrate her years of service to the people of the united states (even if we dont agree with her opinions) and that she has inspired others to serve as she has.  I wish her well in retirement.
What happened?  Also, whatever else you can say about her, you have to respect her willpower at that age.
We pray for the sanctity of all human life.  
God damn. What a crazy news cycle it’s been the past 3-4 days. Wish RBG the best.
[deleted]
Even though we have opposing views, her strength and determination is something all Americans can admire. Speedy recovery, Justice Ginsburg
While I don’t agree with her views I still have a grandmother and would never wish I’ll will on her. 
I'm not wishing her anything. I hope she gets well  soon. Speculation's still fair though, Democrats didn't waste any time after Scalia's sudden demise either.
I do wish she would retire for her own health.  Your health is a fragile thing, and you need to look after it.  Especially liberals as they have no afterlife to look forward to.  Unlike a liberal, I do not wish her harm.
2 issues, first, the broken ribs at 85 (edit) predisposes her to pneumonia and are excruciatingly painful, take forever to heal, even when you’re young and healthy.  Second, the reason she fell is a concern, was it from a cardiac arrhythmia?  I wish her well, but she should have allowed Obama to replace her years ago, and she should have kept her mouth shut about politics.
Democrats frantically recruiting alleged accusers of whoever Trump nominates
The process to replace RBG will make the Kavanaugh confirmation look like a lesson in bipartisanship 
I’m a major Democrat, but I just wanted to pop in and say that the civility in this thread is amazing to see. Sure, some assholes are going to try and be edgy, but you’ll have those in every group.   The top comments all putting a human life over politics brings a smile to my face, and gives me hope that we won’t be so divisive forever. 
Did that evil Brett Kavanaugh push her down?!  
If the fractures are just cracks, as they usually are, the main problem is pain, and she's already too prone to fall asleep for much pain medicine.
Please retire. It's not worth holding your stupid ideology over people's heads in regards to your health.
54 Senators in next session...we won't have this 51/49 nonsense.  Next Justice will be swiftly confirmed.
News reports: antisemitism under Trump causes antisemites to push RBG down the stairs
I hope for a speedy recovery.
It's almost cruel to keep her in her seat. I really do NOT agree with her, but she reminds me of my grandmother. I wish her a speedy recovery and hopefully a peaceful retirement. 
I may not agree with her, but I do not wish her harm.   Here is to a speedy recovery. 🙏🏿
[deleted]
Dude someone fucking predicted that Ginsberg would either pass or leave the supreme court after the midterms. I dont remember who it was but holy crap.
Does anyone know where Jim Acosta was last night?
RGB's replacement tried to touch my boob back in 1983!
Crazy how this happens literally 2 days after midterms. Guess thats at least 3 total supreme court pics for Trump now.
You read my mind pede.  My immediate comment history even proves it.    Ill save you the clicks, on a few other related posts in new, I said "I hope she recovers. I hope she retires, but I hope she recovers too."   Thanks for posting this, really.  
3rd Supreme Court justice on the way 
THIS. I do not in any way rejoice in an old woman falling and breaking ribs. At her age, that could be a serious situation and I hope she recovers quickly and without complications.   ....... and at the same time, imagining the conniption fits the lefties are having over this is pretty much making my day right now.  I need to start bringing popcorn with me to work. 
Thank God for life alert
For health reasons she must step down.    Only uncaring political hacks would jeopardize the health of someone they claim to respect. At her age, complications could easily set in. By remaining quiet and not encouraging retirement their phony respect actually means... "Work yourself to death for my benefit."
Sometimes one's happiness and heath is more important than ideology. Sometimes you need to let go and just be happy with those you care about. RBG has little time left where she will be able to be active and spending it worry about ideology is a waste.
I broke some ribs at 35 and it was hard enough for me. She's 85. This is a very serious injury. I wish her well.
Man -NOTHING- hurts like broken ribs...    Feel so bad for this lady. Could not wish broken ribs on anyone.
She's not going to retire until there's a leftist in office and she's going to die eventually.  I wish no pain or suffering upon her, but the idea that we should hope for her to live until she retires is silly.    &#x200B;  Though I'd still encourage her to retire.
She needs to take care of herself.  She needs to retire...  She is obviously mentally unfit, but this proves physically as well.
My mother-in-law fell, breaking 3 ribs and puncturing her lung, earlier this year. She is 81 and it took about 3 months for her to recover. Wouldn't wish that on anyone. Hope RBG gets better... then retires.
[removed]
I’ve begun to understand why leftists on Reddit hate this sub.   They cannot control the narrative, or vote down posts.   This makes them angry. 
I'm not saying its the Trump curse, but...  Ok, yeah.   I am saying it's the Trump curse.
Court is in session.  This makes the court 5-3 now. 
If she is too frail to enter the court it's time for her to step down. Her old Leftist ideas of population control and gun control died with the NAZIS and Communism.
There are prophecies that trump will appoint 5 Supreme Court justices. Looks like number 3 is coming up. 
RBG is like a fine cheese; everything has it's expiration date.
Get well, but I think it's time to retire. I could't imagine working any job at that age.
Blame the democrats for forcing her to stay and also blame her for not wanting to retire in 2014. But of course we aren’t leftists who wish ill will to their opponents no matter who they are.
1) Jim Acosta banished from the White House.  2) Jeff Sessions resigned.  3) RBG broke ribs in a fall.  Quite an eventful day eh?
I hope that she recovers and will be able to enjoy her well deserved retirement with her family. 
Retire In Peace
I think she planned to step down when Democrats won the Senate. That did not happen of course.Now she will have to face the reality that she may not be able to continue. Can we find another quality justice that is wiling to subject themselves and their family to the living hell that will be forthcoming ? I think we will see the story unfold shortly.
CNN: Trump has yet to deny that he, in fact, pushed the legendary RBG down a flight of stairs.
Remember this bit of fake ass news.

For all those asking what happened.....  Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fractures 3 ribs in fall  https://www.foxnews.com/us/supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-fractures-3-ribs-in-fall
She was a friend of Justice Scalia. I do not agree with her viewpoint, but I sincerely wish her a speedy recovery.
Retire, get well and live another 20 years if you want to. 
 How can you say this sub is a hateful group when you read the comment section and realize subs like r/politics or other leftists circle jerks would never do this for someone on the right.
Where was Acosta at the time of the incident?
Hope she has a speedy recovery.  
I disagree with her positions on most cases, but I gotta give this woman credit:  She's as tough as they come!  &#x200B;  Colon cancer in 1999.  Pancreatic cancer in 2009.  And now we're approaching 2019.  &#x200B;  No one has the great genes of GEOTUS, but Ginsburg might be as close as they come.  ~~Imagine if they had a kid together.~~  Edit:  Never mind, don't do that.  &#x200B;
Coworker just asked if Kavanaugh pushed her.  HAHAHA
I don’t know a single CEO that would allow themselves to remain in control of decision making. McCain should have gracefully resigned, just like RBG if she feels the need.  This isn’t a fucking Aristocracy, people.
Why would I hate her? She refused to leave during Obama thinking Clinton would win and appoint her successor.   I freaking love her.
She already seems to be in a state that it's going to be difficult to recover from this.  Add on that broken ribs can lead to pneumonia, as it did with Rand Paul.
Must have fell over Kavanagh's empties. 
Hopefully this scum falls into her grave next
I called it.  The Trump curse is going to get her, fired a warning shot.  Probably time to reconsider retirement while she still has some golden years left instead of holding out (while nodding out) beyond her performing years just to spite conservatives in a futile attempt to prove something to the mentally ill leftist mob.
Hey I just want to say, I'm a bleeding heart liberal, (also Canadian, so I don't matter here) but I really appreciate this thread.  You guys can be class acts, and it means a lot to me in this goofy era of hate
[removed]
Obviously I despise her narcissistic contempt for the law but I really don't wish her ill, we see what cards we are given and play them to the best of our ability. Sure we joke around but we shouldn't forget that if we don't act and think like the good guys then there are no good guys.
Sad deal, I wish her all the best.  When you're so old that things like "walking in your office" are difficult and pose a risk of great bodily harm, it's probably a good time to hang your hat up and let people more capable take over for you.
I wonder how the left is going to react when president trump gets another pick
Dear God! That anyone would push herself post-*post*-**post** retirement age when she could be home writing books or whatever she would do, has really been awful to watch unfold. (Over the years, at least since her "collapse pic" from 2015 which I'd thought was simply pathetic.)  No matter her past decisions or present-day "thoughts", I sincerely hope she's free to *retire* and that nobody's "making" her continue as SCOTUS. Don't these people have ...*power chairs?* Can't they be HUMANE to each other? Dang.  Heal up, RBG. Don't agree with you in your politics but get better. And get a power chair.
Pr 24:17 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles,  18 lest the LORD see it and be displeased, and turn away his anger from him. 
I do not wish her ill.  I do wish she would step down and then enjoy her remaining time on this earth in peace.
> retirement to heal  LOL you guys
I don't wish her harm, but I'm also not going to be sad when she dies. Fuck Reddit, they cheered when Scalia died.
I don’t
Same concern trolls who were fawning and slobbering over McCain when he had his tumor diagnosis. No, fuck McCain and fuck Ginsburg
Honestly I hope, for the sake of her own well being, that she retires. She’s 85, why not enjoy life for however much more time she has left.
The left won the House, but they just keep losing. Sessions, Acosta, Ginsberg, Senate....whats next?
She needs to be asked to retire by her friends and family.  This is just silly and stubborn of her at this point to continue as a Justice or any line of work at this point. That said I wish her a speedy recovery.
I dislike her judicial policy and her activism from the bench, but I hope she makes a full recovery.  I know it’s got to be hard for her, knowing that her very life is considered a political issue.  
You guys are real gentlemen. I'm not exactly a Trump supporter, but the level of maturity displayed here is refreshing.
Had a conservative judge gotten into an accident, I have no doubt that the leftists would have wished nothing but harm for them.   Once again it shows which side really is the civilized one.

Not a trump supporter but I think this is a good sign. Solid move on his part and I think it will have a positive impact on how everyone sees him.

Why are you talking about abortion when he was talking about marriage?  Seriously, WTF msm!
I sincerely hope he auctions the dollar bill he accepts for salary every year of his presidency and donates the proceeds to veteran charities.  That would be beautiful.

I love how r/politics is trying to spin this as a bad thing. 
But guys he didn't release his tax returns cause he's clearly broke. I mean this is something a broke person would do right?? RIGHT???
By law he'll have to take a dollar. Literally 1 dollar. Trump for Americans. Not for Rs or Ds, Americans. MAGA, Mr. President.  Dear GOD it feels good to say that. 
a good and honest action.  ill bet you anything RIGHT NOW that mainstream media finds a way to make this into a bad thing. i guarantee you!

The Clintons are good people???? He must be playing nice...
Tbh, with the size of the budget the salary is a rounding error.
But he's 150m in debt guyyys he's just going to borrow more money and owe his allegiance to the bankers!  (I actually read this today.  The cognitive dissonance is strong with these people) 
But...but...but I thought he was a monster just doing this for personal enrichment...
Well, he's already richer than all previous Presidents combined... **High energy!**
I would not grudge him a salary. But I admire his attitude in making the offer
Turns down $400,000...does it for love of country...  Would take a bullet for this man.
Local man does it for free
I supported Hillary, but you have to admit that this is a pretty good thing to do.
Isn't nice when CTR isn't around? We are at 97% upvoted!  Gong to be a great first term!
How noble of him. 
Good interview, bad site to read it on, though. Quartz is trash.
Good Guy Donald
[Look at these cucks trying to make this about taxes!](https://i.sli.mg/N5SDQ8.png)
>“Everybody’s a lobbyist down there,” Trump said. “That’s the problem with the system. We’re gonna clean it up. They know the system right now but we’re gonna phase that out, you have to phase it out.”  Oh boy...I'll be watching this promise carefully...if he gets this one right, he can run a lot of lobbyists out of town. They sure as hell won't go away easily.
Number of "new black america deals" by president  Others: 0   Lincoln: 1   Obama: 0   Trump: 1    YOUR MOVE OBAMA  MAKE BLACK AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Guys, I'm going to take one for the team. Donald I will take your salary.
Just annex Europe already, I don't want to miss this!
#GOD-EMPEROR
Meanwhile, Hillary who's already a multimillionaire would sell her only daughter for $250,000.    
Some might interpret this as ignorance, but I thought the most badass part of this was when he said he didn't even know how much the salary was.    He makes so much money he knows there's no way a government job will pay even a fraction of the income he expects.
1.6 million dollars closer to being out of debt and he's not even inaugurated yet. That's already more than Obama did. 
Ya know if he just turns around his climate policy he's gonna be a great president. His denial of climate change is really the only thing I can think of that's holding him back. 
**THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF DOTA!**
$1 in all pennies to fuck with the fed. 
He should open up a prosecution of the Clintons
#BEST PRESIDENT EVER
I don't like what FLOTUS said about cyber-bulling which is bullshit and anti-free speech.
Personally, I would have taken the $400,000/yr and donated all of it to various charities if I were as well off as Trump, but that's just me.
Thank you president Trump for your service. God bless america.
didn't he also say he won't accept money from lobbyist and ended up quietly accepting those donations anyway? I would not judge him on his "words" but rather his deeds 
They lost me at "hate-peddling Breitbart news".  Cucky, biased,  shameful ""journalism". 
>On whether he still believes the US electoral process is rigged and that the electoral college is problematic: > >Trump indicated he still believes this. Said the president-elect, “I’m not going to change my mind just because I won.”  #WHAT A FANTASTIC PRESIDENT WE HAVE

ITT: lazy self-victimizing millennials try to rationalize an apparently selfless act of civil duty 
qz is run by Clinton shills, why are we giving them revenue by upvoting it?
Forgive my ignorance, but where does this money go? I mean it's $569k/year for 4 years. That's $2'276'000. It has to go somewhere right?
He already earns several times more anyway. There is literally no reason why he would be in it for the money.
*I*'ll take it.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate?
Is this the same Russian hacking that showed Podesta saying he wished the San Bernardino terrorist was some average white dude murdering muslim-named people to fit his liberal narrative?
It's amazing how they are upset that Hillary was exposed but okay with all the bullshit she was up to. 
4d chess  The media will have to cover it because he said "illegally" 
Cyber attack + privelege = Hack    Cyber attack - privelege = Social justice
I love getting my shitposts early in the morning. It make me feel spicy for the whole day! 🌶🌶🇷🇺🇷🇺💯💯
This could be a veiled warning. The Dems have offered a target-rich environment for prosecution.
Does Trump ever sleep?
If the content in the emails was so bad that it greatly affected the election shouldn't the hackers be congratulated for what they did and not demonized?  This all makes no sense.
People on r/redacted are asking Obama to start WW3 over these leaks. Anything to stop Trump from being president. It's terrifying.
Cast out the line and see who bites
Some of those twitter responses are WEW as fuck.
rotfl:  "Ann CoulterVerified account ‏@AnnCoulter   **Two sources claim it was Sanders-supporting Dems who leaked to Wikileaks not Russia. So it was communists who leaked, not former communists."**
Now that's real donald trump! 
I LOVE THIS MAN
So much this!!! It amazes me that people are still so enamored with the MSM that even though they know it can't be trusted, have been lead through two wars based on lies for almost 15 years against two countries that had little to do with 911 and ignored the two that funded and housed those bastard terrorists, they still look to the MSM to validate the facts.   The fact is the MSM is not talking about the content of those emails. They're just going on and on and on and on and on with their "experts" about how it was Russia without any inkling of proof. They're just going to say it was Russia until the polling verifies that enough Americans agree with it. 
Fake news like Clinton was murdering Trump in every poll ever?  They are all complicit. 
Now we should list out every single damaging info revealed in the wikileaks, whenever someone comeup with hacking claim.
Uh oh... 1st slot of /r/all.  We might trigger some teenagers.
Oh my god the first chain of replies.  Cody Johnston ‏@drmistercody  2 hours ago "@realDonaldTrump The information derived from the attack does not negate or lessen the relevance of the source of the attack."  Isn't it the other way around? The source of the "attack" does not negate or lessen the relevance of the CORRUPTION and ILLEGAL acts that the DNC were up to. 
I love the smell of shitposts in the morning. Smells like... victory. 
hey guys this sticky is #25 on all, was the filter removed slightly?
I love how the hacks revealed how horrible the media is as well as the amount of collusion that takes place as well has multiple DNC chairs unethically worked with one of the campaigns as well has revealed questionable donations from various groups and countries and they are so outraged about this because none of us were supposed to know about it and therefore a new election is supposed to take place.   Ok
SHITPOSTER IN CHIEF
#HE HASNT EVEN STARTED ON HER
I'm not completely used to the President speaking directly, speaking the truth, and speaking truly on behalf of the people. But I'll get used to it.  MAGA! 
All the fucking lib tards are whining: "you're a con" "delete your account" "fraud" "Russia"     With arguments like that, liberals will never take an office again w/o malingering   Edit: from yards to tards
# 3:09 AM  ^0_o
Every morning I wake up to a new presidential shitpost.   What a beautiful time to be alive!
So Hillary and the DNC conspired with the media to get trump nominated in the [first place](http://www.salon.com/2016/11/09/the-hillary-clinton-campaign-intentionally-created-donald-trump-with-its-pied-piper-strategy/) because they thought they would have the best chance against him, but when he actually wins they blame the Russians. Not to mention she actually stole the nomination from bernie. 
Ouch
Funny, as much as NPR loves to talk about his twits, zero mention of this one. Also still zero mention of Elon Musk meeting with Trump
 Hey /u/Mind__Mischief,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Look at the replies.  They still don't get it.
nobody knows the rules?? the rules are  - nobody is allowed to talk about the  contents of the DNC leaks, only talk about russia  - only debbie wasserman shultz and donna brazile are allowed to influence elections  - it was her turn   - (shrieking)  
Wew
[deleted]
These comments are just insults being thrown at him. No logic was used during the tweeting of these comments.  "no it's the one where Russia caused you to win the election."   How? What did they do to cause it? It seems the guy tweeting it has zero critical thinking skills.    "Go back to bed with Vladmir".   Seriously how do you just talk shit openly to a guy that exposed corruption that is undeniable to your own party? These people are the craziest I've seen in a while.
I know, 4D chess and everything but still, it's disingenuous to even suggest that the DNC/podesta leaks have anything to do with the liberal's current fuckery. He implicitly acknowledges that there was a meaningful "cyberattack" while in my opinion he should simply pursue the angle of p@ssw0rd-Podesta giving out the mails all by himself and the DNC leaks being leaked by a mole.
Oh no he did not just say that!
[deleted]
How come Noone against Trump can realize that BOTH the  convention leaks and the Podesta emails were LEAKS. The hacking was Because Hillary let foriegn governments hack her private home server. Please GOD, let these people red pill to realize that she got people killed and pissed off half the world exposing above top secret shit. WAKE THE FUCK UP. 
AIRHORN!!!
Ha! this reached the top of r/all
Remember how Hillary wanted to implement that no fly zone that would piss off Russia and escalate tensions between US and Russia? What if Russia didnt want to fuck with us so they leaked the DNCs info
Swear if the dems had a brain they would be dangerous! 
does this guy ever sleep? I love it. HIGH ENERGY
[deleted]
Oi boys, we got back to the top of r/All !!!
Here's the issue I have with all of this. The leaked emails didn't come with a narrative. It was just an information dump, and the American people sifted through it themselves and came to their own conclusions about what it meant. It was a case of pure evidence and zero propaganda. Sure, once discoveries were made they were shared and a number of narratives began to evolve around them. But it all started with text email dumps.  Now the leftist are doing the exact opposite. They're putting out a *story* first. They're priming outrage with 'fake news' and 'Russian hackers who stole our election'. But, they're not providing *evidence* of any of these claims. Just telling us this is 'the truth' and what to believe about it. Any evidence offered to counter the pre-determined narrative is ignored or dismissed as being a part of it. That's pure, ludicrously-obvious propaganda.  It's crazy to me that no one sees how obvious this all is. I can't figure out if it's incompetence or desperation...
TRUMP TRAIN!!!!
LOVE how he foils their blatant deflection of the focus away from the SUBSTANCE of the leaked e-mails onto the SOURCE. Shines that spotlight right back on the SUBSTANCE of what was leaked.  BTW pedes we should all stop saying HACKED, the verb the left desperately wants the national lexicon to adopt. We should all keep saying ***LEAKED***, as Julian has confirmed the e-mails were, not hacked, and not by Russians, but by a disgruntled DNC staffer. They were LEAKED.  #**LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED LEAKED**#

Why are the Liberalist and the Media Retards acting like they are so shocked by this!? We knew about the Russians a month BEFORE the election! I feal like Im being Gaslighted. It doesnt matter then and it doesnt matter now.
watch all the cucks downvote cause they dont accept the truth
The gift that keeps on giving!
The democrats, who are all about transparency, are upset the emails revealed too much transparency
Scott Adams said it early and said it best and it still holds true: Trump has brought a flame thrower to a stick fight.
Regardless of who did it, I love the DNCs hypocrisy.   "They are evil for exposing evil!!1!11!!1"  "They are corrupt for exposing corruption11!1!11!"  Since when is it Wrong, to be Right?

i'm literally shaking
That's what I keep trying to tell the "neutral" people of /r/politics DNC is playing a really dangerous game. What they are alleging is, Putin can take down the DNC without having to draw a single fire arm. Basically Obama and staff are reaffirming that Putin is playing chess and Obama is playing checkers, with a broken board and missing pieces. How pathetic does that makes them look? Further, lets say that everything they say is true about Russia, even if time after time after time Julian Assange denies this to be the case. Then why make the investigation so public? Why not, you know...keep it secret so that the people you are trying to catch aren't aware that you are actively looking for them? I mean these are cyber criminals and you're giving them the heads up, might as well given them fake passports with 3 million dollars and tell them to take five years to hide and then you were going to come looking for them but likely not. 
Just a reminder that Assange said his source was not Russia, and his friend and cooperative said it was DNC insiders that leaked the emails
Why is nobody talking about the fact that Hillary and co's carelessness with their emails is what probably left them vulnerable to hacking, wherever the attack came from?
SAVAGE
Yep, they're completely glossing over the criminality of Hillary Clinton and the DNC.  
#WEW LAD

Read the replies to this tweet, libs are losing their shit.  How long can this continue?
The cuck logic on twitter:  > The information derived from the attack does not negate or lessen the relevance of the source of the attack.  Then why are you using the same argument when we talk about wikileaks? Hypocrite much?   > She received the question unethically, not illegally.  So it's okay to be unethical? Well she did lie under oath and delete her emails under subpoena but I guess that's okay as long as you're with her.  > Her receiving a debate question does not mean that she would make a bad President, or that you would make a better one.  Sure, ignore the millions of illegal shit she has done and downplay her crimes. SURE.
I love president Trump.

The left is insane now. We might actually go into nuclear war just because they can't stand losing. I've lost all respect for anyone who would vote for a Democrat after this election cycle. 
The Demorats are framing this issue in the form of an ad hominem attack.  JHC, they teach you this your first real English/Debate class in high school.  The source of the information (truth) is not relevant.  The real story here is that the MSM have traditionally been the ones manipulating the electorate, now that they have a bit of competition, they are pissed off.
If Russian hacking did affect the election(Which there's still no evidence, proof, testimony, or confirmation that this even happened. Just an outlandish claim with nothing to back it up.), I say we should just call it even since we already did get undeniable proof that the DNC rigged the presidential debates in Hillary's favor.
I love how this post is only 56% upvoted. Cucks are everywhere.
Politifact rates this as: liar liar pants on fire.  Head of DNC cheating and giving away debate questions not technically illegal.

THE TWEET THAT STARTED IT ALL OFF!
This is what the first move in 4D chess looks like. 
Come at the king, best not miss.

Awesome.  In case people don't know, Trump had actually been considering running for a verrrry long time. In 2000, for example, Trump wanted to join the Reform Party.   But the reason he decided against it may shock liberals! (buzzfeed emoticons here)  >New York Times, Feb. 14, 2000: Mr. Trump painted a fairly dark picture of the Reform Party in his statement, noting the role of Mr. Buchanan, along with the roles of David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, and Lenora Fulani, the former standard-bearer of the New Alliance Party and an advocate of Marxist-Leninist politics.  >“The Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a communist, Ms. Fulani,” he said in his statement. “This is not company I wish to keep.”
Can you believe that poor guy was actually catching flak for that tweet? Unbelievable how the left can be so childish.
All the tweets and memes will be put into the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library at some point. 
4D chess in that tweet.  In two words, "Be careful!" Donald Trump made the following points:  * I might run. * If I run, I won't just run, I will win. * My presidency will bring change that might not be welcomed by all (corrupt people). * Don't you dare say I "hate America."
So John Oliver was taking credit for what Russel Steinberg actually did? Sad.

Holy fuck the madman 
Trump had already trademarked 'Make America Great Again' by the time he sent this tweet.   7D Rocket League.
*AIRHORN.WAV*
BLOWN THE FUCK OUT!
begun the #MAGA wars have ....
I like how his pic is a cartoon of him holding a ha ha sign...guess who had the last laugh. :D
I wonder how that guy feels now
"If you love America so much, you should make American Great Aga-"  Done. Next?
**THE GOD EMPEROR CANNOT BE STOPPED** 
This will be in history books! I need this framed!!
Might I ask what it was that made the Don disliked by the left/seen as a joke back in 2013? I was largely unaware of him till 2015. All I've heard is that he tried to run a few times before. 
This guy has to be the Steve Bartman for the left.
What a madman
Anyone know what the pres. was fed up with that this guy tweeted him to run for office?
Didn't he actually plan to run for president, like.. since ever? Once the situation gets too bad?
I love walking down memory lane.  You never know who or what you're going to run into.    Hillary's people should have made that walk a lot more often.  Those that don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it......over and over again.  
 Hey /u/-INFOWARS-,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.

He tweet, He run, He won😄
I've been so giddy lately. Every time I think about the tens of thousands of young millennials crying and being "suicidal" puts the biggest smile on my face.  Maybe because they told me for a year I was a racist, sexist, delusional for thinking he could win. I am unintelligent for supporting an "orange baffoon"  But who's laughing now? Lol I remember a HRC supporter telling me she'll feel bad for me when HRC gets 500 electoral votes.. LOL
#OH LAWD
HAHA!
Has anyone saved the tweet The Don did from a similar time were he announces he's running with a photo shopped pic surrounded by explosions?   I think jeans and cowboy boots are involved too.

Donald is such a mad lad. 
THANKS RUSS!!  You  did your part to save the free world! 😄
This arrogant, condescending 'roast' by Obama of Trump also probably motivated The Donald to win, too! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8TwRmX6zs4

I remember when he teased running in 2012.  I supported that back then. But it never came to be.
Thanks Russell!
God bless Russ Steinberg.  The whole world should know that he is the single individual that got the Trump Train rolling down the tracks. To him goes the credit for getting Mr Trump motivated to MAGA.
I thought it was when Obama insulted him in public at a dinner.
SO MUCH BTFO OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF.  TRUMP LITERALLY IS NOT CAPABLE OF LOSING.

CHALLENGE **ACCEPTED**
Thanks Russ! :D
thank you Russ Steinberg
Time Traveler Trump, in an alternate timeline hillary started WWIII so Trump used rest of his assest to develope a time travel machine, he went back in time and posted this tweet, thus closing the loop and preventing the WWIII. 
is this legit?
Huehehuehuehuehue
He started talking about presidency in around 2006 atleast. Maybe even earlier
The tweet heard around the world!
Russell wasnt careful. 
Oh wow that's great.

This is glorious.
Who is Russell Steinberg?
Thank you.
We should all message this guy and thank him for getting Trump in the running!
[Here's another good one, I remember watching this and thinking to myself "Hey, that would be great". It finally happened!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IubTYGi12_I&feature=youtu.be)
After Trump was elected, he actually deleted the tweet. He was apparently getting lots of hate and threats.
"IS THAT A DARE?!"
Thank you Russel Steinberg!
Great coverage https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLKP_lPiqpc
Talk about someone who is a dedicated winner.... A freaking tweet inspired a man so greatly that he literally went and won the presidential election going 17-0!!!!!!  MAGA
I honestly feel like Trump has been building up to this moment for his entire life. 
Little did he know...

Because I read the Username /u/-INFOWARS-:   InfoWars is actually a part of the Illuminati spreading half-truths to cause more diversion and distraction.   Be warned!
This Is Not A Partisan Issue. 300,000,000 Americans Want To Know, Why Did The Killer Do This, What Did The Killers Note Say And Why Are You Hiding It. We Need To Prevent This From Happening In The Future. This Needs To Be On Top Of R/All.
So they interview the brother who lives on the opposite side of the map, but leave out the brother with a criminal record who lives one state away?  https://www.tmz.com/2017/10/04/stephen-paddock-brother-bruce-rap-sheet-arson-threats-las-vegas/
We know its not pro-Trump or generally pro-nationalist in nature. Otherwise it would be on the news 24/7.
I am pretty sure that is a box cutter, not a pen... I am almost positive it is a Kobalt retractable box cutter from Lowes as I use one almost daily.
The real mindfuck will be when the note says 'because fuck you thats why'  or says that there is no reason
We should want the truth, yes, but don't rush to conclude that it's a false flag and then seek the evidence to justify that conclusion. We have no idea what the paper says. It could be a suicide note. It could be a valet parking receipt. 
CNN: Our sources tell us the note reads: "why did you let me buy a gun America? Why is this so readily available. My wife's 3 yr old child asked me why I have this gun, I said everyone has them."
The note will say whatever they want it to say.  
It's an open investigation. 
Charlottesville was in the news for weeks, mass protests, statues pulled down.  The killer was called a nazi in a matter of minutes.  We were all then called Nazis, Trump was literally Hitler.   Las Vegas killer?    Yep, Coulter's Law.
Looks like a utility knife, duct tape and possibly a hotel menu.
This tragedy is already losing interest among news outlets, including Reddit.  Now its back to muh Russia and muh racism in Puerto Rico 
The FACT that we know nothing tells us everything we need to know pedes. Come on.... If this was a Repub we would all fucking know by now. They need time to manipulate all the evidence 
This is the first time in US history a spree-shooter has been a multi millionaire. He had knowledge on how to illegally modify the weapons to cause maximum damage.   He rented two rooms and went between two sniping points for maximum carnage. He set up cameras that viewed the hotel hallways to monitor police response.  He had an incredibly detailed strategy to ensure a high kill count.  The is all from a retired accountant with a gambling problem?   None of this adds up. My friends, this is the stuff conspiracy theories are made of.
Also that "note" could be that crap that hotels leave in the room.
What people are missing here is that, if there is a note and it's being held by the feds, the note could be held because it implicates someone higher up as motivation. Any other individuals involved and their wanted status would be worth keeping under wraps until all the pieces are together.

If cops took picture of the scene, you bet there is a picture of the note. Just a matter of time of it being leaked.
Hey FBI...What did the note say?  
If there is a deep conspiracy involved with this shooting, then the note will be a red herring. 
Ugh.  Leather shoes and white socks.
He was anti trump. Thats against the media agenda so it won't be made public on the MSM. 
So far no motive given. Yet quickly they said not ISIS.   Very strange consider, ANTIFA publish a start to their agenda of revolution beginning November (Specifically November 4).     Also very strange that ISIS announced twice that this was their man.    Also very strange, Multiple  camera angles (3) captured  muzzle flashes from the 4-5 floor all to the exact sound of the delayed gun fire.    Also very strange, Mandalay bay has receipt from a restaurant showing service to two people on the 27th. yet the FBI stated that he checked in on the 28th and was a lone wolf   Also very strange that the guns are thrown around the room randomly and his pistol is above his head by 3 feet and bullet casing on top of blood are not covered in blood.   Also very strange in the publish photo of Stephen Paddock after killing himself there is blood on his chest which looks to be a chest wound.     Also very strange that WE SEE A NOTE YET FBI HAS NOT CONFIRMED OR DENIED ITS EXISTENCE.    ANYONE think that all this is very strange and yet all we hear is MUHHH Gun Control???
"Not a partisan issue." 88% upvoted.  It may not be a partisan issue, but Redditors are turning it into partisan politics, as usual. Spoiler alert: they're autistic lefties.
I hope that the investigators are holding some real information close, in order to roll up possible co-conspirators.    Go ahead and ask your questions, anyway.  They need to know that we are interested.
Look at all the celebrities calling for gun control. Meanwhile, this incident is like something out of the movies, vegas, gunman, casino...hypocrisy. 
Don't care what color he was.  Where's the motive? That's all I'm concerned about. 
I'm surprised spaz hasn't reset the up votes back to 0 yet.
First time the MOTIVES UNCLEAR tag hasn't been sarcastic
Just want to comment. Vegas cops are pretty based people. That generally are NOT lefitsts. This includes the chief. I say this because one of my colleagues who lives in Vegas told me a 3 people from his church were shot, whilst several others attended, and he has given me the rundown (all 3 lives. 2 that were shot were twin teenage girls from his congregation).  Anyway, they may only be holding out info for the sake of the interrogation today of the girlfriend. No need to give her a heads up on what they do and don't know.  So, I think it will come to light what happened, but they maybe aren't releasing it right away. Of course, the ONLY reason it hasn't leaked out yet is because these are honorable police officers. In the FBI, while most are, there are a lot of political types and the ONLY reason it hasn't leaked out in their case is because it makes the left look bad. The police would've been honorable either side it looked bad. The FBI only has leakers that make the right look bad. Just how I see it.  But ya, I agree, they know and the only reason we don't yet is because the guy had a political agenda that makes the left look bad. 2 leftist mass shooters. What is going on?  The hate and violence comes from the left.
#HOLY SHIT!    17,679 @ 52% upvotes?  How is that even possible?  Must have been hundreds of thousands, if not millions of votes in total!  What living entity could downvote such a thing as this anyway?
There's a 100% chance they know why this guy did what he did I guarantee his computers and/or house told the whole tale.  Why not give the public some indication for the motive so as to try to address the fears and concerns people have with how to prevent this in the future??  To me the reason is very clear, this is not a lone wolf loon or right wing extremist this is either Antifa or ISIS no doubt about it.  Funny the FBI leaks like a sieve when it's about trump but now they're air tight 
why is this being downvoted so hard?  maybe some people don't want to know the truth?
91% upvoted and it is at zero.

But the answer is partisan - the mass murder targeted what was perceived as a demographic that would likely consist of people more pro-Trump than pro-Hillary. The killer carried out what is an ANTIFA wet dream of what they would like to see done to Trump supporting Americans.
Paddock started stockpiling guns just as Trump was elected president. Coincidence?  [Link](http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-paddock-las-vegas-shooter-bought-33-firearms-last-year-2017-10)
i dont know man.... im willing to bet there are a bunch clinton voters who ***dont*** want to know whats in that note.
It was an FBI ISIS sting. Room full of guns? Check. Cameras everywhere including the hall? Check. Paddock has both a head wound and very bad chest wound. It's the Fast and Furious again. the LVPD is aware and NOT happy. So a leak has sprung. Dinesh D'Souza has given all the reasons why is ISN'T a lone shooter, a suicide a whatever.
Trump won't let it lay, we'll find out.   Hillary would have had the place already burned to the ground, along with any Americans in it.
Welcome back to /r/all
I am looking at the lake
Just wondering, whys the pen so "yugggeee"? Seriously tho lol 
I upvoted. America deserves to know!
One thing i think we can safely say is that it wasn't racially motivated. If that was the case, they would have rushed that shit to the headlines.
we won’t get to the stop of r/all... the Donald never does anymore 
Enhance
I'm pretty sure it's only 4 days into the investigation sooooo
How do you know its not a shopping list for materials  to carry out plan. Or a note pad and pen many hotels provide? It could be a multitude of things.. 
It's an active investigation, if the note had any information that may lead to a broader investigation they would risk it by releasing it.

I was leaning toward conspiracy or false flag but now I truly think he was just fucked up from his medications.   Hear me out- We know he liked to partake in high risk gambling, he owned two airplanes, made risky deals which made him into a multi millionaire. The guy seems to be the personality type who needed risk and high thrills to feel happy.   We know his father was a convicted bank robber and on the FBI’s most wanted list and even escaped prison at one point. He was also labeled a psychopath. My thought is Stephen has the same genes and was possibly a psychopath too and couldn’t feel or empathize the way normal people do. But maybe he never cared about that because as long as he got his thrill from high risk taking, he could feel alive and somewhat normal.   It was reported that he started taking medication for depression and anxiety four months ago.  My theory is that desensitized him so much so that even risky high stakes gambling couldn’t give him that thrill anymore and he had nothing to live for any longer.   His psychopathic nature began to show through and he planned one last grand daddy risky event that he hoped would allow him to feel that thrill one last time before ending his life.   It might just be that simple. I wish the news would start focusing on how dangerous these prescribed medications are. Some people say they literally feel nothing while they’re taking them. Like they’re a shadow in the room. 
It seems to me that there are only two possible explanations.  1) He is totally insane (the mentally ill theory that the press is pushing) or 2) he could be a recent convert to the religion of peace who somehow has been radicalized.  I know the latter seems unlikely, given how unlikely Muslim violence is, but it is a possible explanation.  /s  https://www.jihadwatch.org/2017/10/las-vegas-sheriff-on-shooter-did-this-person-get-radicalized-unbeknownst-to-us
If a note does exists and emerges to the public, I urge you all to be careful not to jump to any conclusions while reading it. If the note is pro-Trump, it could very well be Democratic martyr trying to radicalize the left base by pretending to be pro-Trump. And the vice versa is the same; if the note is anti-Trump, it could be a Republican trying to radicalize the right. After all, the shooter was prepared to take his own life: it’s very possible he pretended to be the opposite of what he believes in order to create outrage.
There is an open investigation as far as I know. They obviously can’t just tell the public everything they know immediately. What if someone has information not available to the public? Then they know that person was involved. Plus they don’t want to mislead us if something they think is important ends up being wrong or unrelated. They have to figure out the whole story before presenting it. Have patience these people want answers as much as the rest of us. 
Be sure to drink your Ovaltine
Thank you for the big red circle I wouldn't have seen the pen and note in the picture without it.

ENHANCE!
1. Milk  2. Eggy weggs 3. A bit of the old ultraviolence
Probably says "Clinton hired me" or "my religion made me do it"
Was he registered to vote?
That is a box cutter, green frog painter's tape, a piece of paper.
Note or not, there’s video. And undoubtedly he spewed forth his garbage manifesto there
Obviously he's not a Trump supporter or else the media would have jumped on that the first second 
Playing devils advocate here, but don’t most hotels come with a nightstand with a pen and paper or notepad in them?
Fully agree. I have seen so many comments on social media since then saying something to the effect that it is callous or hateful to want answers and that we should simply mourn the dead. Yes, we mourn the dead but we will be mourning many more if we do not demand to know what the motive for this so that we can better protect ourselves. 
18k up votes but not in popular. 
Still can’t believe we are 3+ days into this and no motive has been revealed.   Also the GF is playing the babe in the woods routine. It’s bullshit. I can’t text my buddies without my own girlfriend thinking I am cheating. That is, if I had a girlfriend or buddies.
tinfoil hat off.  its an ongoing investigation, they aren't going to show the world everything, YET.  Chill out and wait.  Jumping to sooo many conspiracy theories.  Is soup and a sandwich really lunch for 2?
I think they know they fucked up, knowing other shooters escaped, and are trying to cover their tracks to save face... bastards.... we want the fucking truth!
I hope it turns out to be a drawing of Dickbutt, just to make this whole thing even more mysterious.
Looks more like a box cutter, neon tape, and the hotel's TV guide. 
He was an arms seller for the FBI that got intercepted by ISIS and killed. He had been selling guns to the Philippines for over 2 years. Remember Leeland Yee (D) California? He was caught on similar charges.  Everything fits. Him having "no political affiliations" is because his job was apolitical in nature. He had 13 homes all as storage points for his weapons. His gambler persona was just an excuse to rent out hotel rooms for his deals. He had baby monitors set up because he thought it was just another sting operation. All his weapons were of high quality (Daniel Defense rifles were in all the pictures, all are easily $2,000) because they were sale items.   The motive is still buried because there are still ISIS terrorists on the loose and the FBI just accidentally made Fast and Furious look like a fucking joke. 
Hillary funds Antifa violence.
Calm down, guy doodled dick butt. 
That looks like a roll of tape and a razor knife.

This is from the NYT on the alleged shooter.  > Investigators unearthed multiple job applications, with Mr. Paddock’s fingerprints on file, as part of records reflecting his employment as a letter carrier for the Postal Service in the mid 1970s; as an Internal Revenue Service agent from 1978 to 1984; and as an auditor focused on defense contracts, a job he held until 1985. He also worked in the 1980s for one of the companies that later combined to form Lockheed Martin, the aerospace   If I was working in defense/intelligence, this is what my resume might look like. 
I'm going with mental illness for 400, Trebek. 
Post it on a non partisan subreddit. . 
From what I'm able to make out the last part says "Hillary dindunuffin wrong..."
At this point what difference does it make?
That is a roll of duck tape and and a box cutter. Also, I was listening to the scanner (after most were taken down) and heard there were four there, not one. See my comment history. 
It seems as if, if it was a suicide note, it would have been rather quickly released...
Keep in mind the LVPD and FBI still doesn't know who shot Tupac, so don't hold your breath.
This guy doesn't strike me as a sentimental 'This is why I did it letter' type.
Could be his to-do list. He clearly had it planned out to the last detail.
Downvote bots incoming
or perhaps they could tell us where the 100000 wire went to in the Philippines.
Glad to see this on the front page!!!
One of two things: It either said he did it in the name of ISIS or it was a list to send to Santa.
Fucking feds
It doesn't look written on, more like just the stationary every hotel gives out.
The guy wired 100k to Philippines day before. 
Mk ultra...  Never forget we've had mind controlled assassins since the 60s 
It lasted on the front page for about 1/3 of the time anything else with the same upvotes did. Lol. Censorship at it's finest.

Break down the items in the pic...  What do y'all think they are?  I see pen, paper, duct tape (green), and some other object.
The media and my fellow Americans treat me like I am a TERRORIST because I support Trump...I am scared to show my support for Trump due to the fear of being beaten bloody, or having my belongings destroyed. When did voting... make me a terrorist? I think it's time for people to wake up...
come out of the closet folks don't be intimidated. 
We are, you have many brothers and sisters across our great land thanks to President Trump. We will be silenced no more.

It's a sad state of affairs when you have to be in fear for vocally supporting your candidate.  The media has done this, and they have divided the country horribly.  It will die down though.  Donny will get into office and we will all celebrate.  I'll be at inauguration cheering him on!
DEAR LORD. I worked on this on and off all day adding how I felt and changing it through the day!!! Thank you for stickying!!! 
HARRY REID just said on the senate floor that Trump's victory has increased HATE CRIMES in the US.  What he doesn't tell you is that those are hate crimes being committed against Trump supporters!
The irony of it all, is that the majority of the protesters didn't even vote.
I did not vote for Donald Trump but I am angry that 60+ million Americans are being written off as racist and sexist so that the left can pretend they are the party of the moral high ground.  We have allowed party and politicians to keep us divided.  We need to listen to each other, there's common ground.  It should be all of US, Americans, together, against those corporate shills in DC.
If Trump voters were rioting and doing this they'd be called domestic terrorists.   The left though are free speech activists standing up for what they believe.   Absolutely despicable that democratic leaders like Reid and Pochoahantes are encouraging this behavior.

I can sympathize. I think we're witnessing the complexity of the human mind.  Things I take for granted is difficult or impossible for another person to comprehend.  Like not letting people from an incompatible culture into you country by the millions, or them demonising white men and still expecting them to vote for you, and then labeling them as ignorant racists when they don't.  I think Scott Adams is right. Rationality isn't an inherent character trait for most people. They "think" with their emotions, and that has lead us into a situation where our civilization has a significant risk of being destroyed.  This is seemingly what leftists want, judging by their increasingly hateful rhetoric against stupid racist male Trumpsupporters.  I wish we lived in a rational and calm world, but too many people are lost in a parallel world to ours. They've watching a different movie.  We still have to fight for what we think is right, and we just won a significant victory. Hopefully there will be others. And hopefully we will eventually win the decent people over to our side so we can defeat the people who quite simply live in another reality than us. A fake reality judging by the detrimental effects of the causes they fight vehemently for. 
The greatest thing to come out of this election after MAGA is our community of centipedes. We don't give a fuck about your "identity" besides that you love to MAGA and liberty (and have disavow if necessary).   After MAGA I would of course put Trump. KEK transcends lists. He is master of the based digits after all. 
This post was #1 on /r/all a few moments ago, and now I don't see it at all.  What the fuck happened?
Fear. I'm a bleeding heart liberal and my FB page has been filled with posts about how Trump winning is indicative that bigotry and hate are rife in America and how this victory is a sign that we(?) need to fight even harder to combat these things.   I'm surprised - not only do I not buy that most of those who voted for Trump are somehow hateful and prejudiced, it's incredibly hypocritical for people who espouse compassion and inclusion to react with comments about fighting and battle.   It's really weird being on the losing side; my gut reaction was fear and disbelief and at the same time it's like - wow, this must be what it's been like for people on the other end of the political spectrum when liberal candidates have won elections - it's eye opening.   It sucks for me AND for better or worse this dude is my president, chosen through the democratic process, and that deserves respect. Honestly, I think Trump supporters deserve a lot more respect than they're getting or have gotten, particularly in the MSM. The fact that people are concerned about "coming out" as Trump supporters because they're being publicly shamed is bullshit. That's not progressive, and I hope people who identify as such will recognize it.  TL;DR  This lib thinks shaming Trump supporters is totally unjust and hypocritical, too. (Sorry if this is an inappropriate post for this sub, I read the rules but pobody's nerfect) 
Exactly why I won't come out as a Trump supporter in real life even though I love and have loved the man for many years. In my state, your political affiliation isn't covered by the employment discrimination laws. You can be fired for being a Trump supporter. I also live in a very liberal [god I hate where I live] area and have actually seen a car window get smashed when it had a Trump sticker on it.     Only my based Dad knows that I am a Trump supporter because several of my closest family members won't even speak to me anymore because I told them to grow up when their candidate [Crooked] lost. They're the typical cry baby fascist assholes going around vomiting hate all over the place. God forbid any of my friends find out.     If I come out as a Trump supporter publicly I lose: All of my friends, More family members, My job, and my property. Tell me again liberals, who are the fascists ones? Who are the ones America is supposed to be afraid of?     edit: And to this day I will still sit down and listen to opposing views and opinions if they are presented in a rational way but if: You smashed windows in, burned the American flag, beat up people with opposing views, spit in their faces, called for their deaths and rape and name called? I will never listen to what you have to say. 
I've lost clients in my business over my support for Trump. It sucks. I've never been physically attacked, but verbally attacked quite a number of times. Never seen anything like it in my lifetime.
Damn man. I'm about as liberal as they come, but this is bullshit. The literal point of America was created to be a place where all ideas, no matter what the fuck they are, are allowed to flourish without fear of ANY sort of backlash.   For fucks sake, the Neo Nazis march in my town every year since as far as I can remember, and people just let it happen and ignore if they aren't nazis. It's not that hard to just look the other way.   I was a Sanders supporter and Trump voter in a blue state so my vote my no difference anyways, but I feel for you man.   Thanks for spreading this too, as it will make me vigilant in my protection of my opposition no matter where it may be.   If someone starts getting fucked with for any opinion, I am going to make it a point to step the fuck in and shut that shit down. Bullying and brigading is ridiculous, and shameful. More than that, it's unAmerican. 
Left-leaning America and Hillary supporters: WE ARE NOT THE ENEMY. But the media was PAID TO INSIST WE WERE. We're AMERICANS, just like you are. We don't have to agree on anything BUT the commonality of being FELLOW AMERICANS. Everything else can and MUST be worked out, compromised on, discussed, TOGETHER.  i dont care about anything you label yourself as other than FELLOW AMERICAN.   ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🐛🐛❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🐛🐛
I've been afraid to show my support for Trump throughout this whole election. But now with these protests I've become absolutely fed up with these cry babies in the streets, actually terrorizing this country.   So I decided to buy a MAGA hat and I'll be wearing it around for the next 4 years. Fuck these protestors, no longer will I let them terrorize me into hiding my beliefs. 
The "what I see in trump was supposed to be the #TrumpTheEstablishment video =_=
as a lifelong moderate liberal, i saw what was going on and have since shifted to moderatre conservative. but this election year i voted straight fucking republican. i have been pissed off at the status quo for so long and the way sjws have been destroying our democracy, when i saw them cry election night i got a fucking hardon. 
I live in Oregon. I didn't vote for Donald Trump, I'll admit that I voted third party, but I wish him the best and seeing the Republican Party come together like this is absolutely amazing. I might have been wrong about DT, but again my vote barely counts in a deep-blue state like Oregon where Portland, Salem, and Eugene own the vote.  However, I am afraid to wear anything patriotic. It doesn't even have to be politics related, I wore a *"Captain America"* T-Shirt and two punks approached me and kept harassing me about being "anti-mexican." I think it's time to move out of this forsaken state...
Long time lurker, first time poster.  Thank you. Truly, thank you.  Thank you for putting into words, feelings I could not. I see all these people on the news, social media, people afraid that Trump supporters will be wandering the streets and will beat them on sight. But it's the opposite. It's the centipedes being beaten, their property being destroyed, their freedoms infringed.  We need to stop all this. Everyone needs to drop this us vs them shit. We need to unite against globalism and focus on a country so divided, we need group cry sessions because we didn't get our way.  And we can NOT blame them! We can't! It isn't their fault. We can't blame them, because all they know of Trump is the ghastly caricature that the media painted of him.   He isn't a perfect man. No one is. But he is my president. And I have faith in him.  I've always considered myself a Texan before an American. But I am finally proud to call myself an American once again.  Build the wall. Drain the swamp. Get them out.   Texas; Out.
I'm with you brother. Can't even voice my thoughts at work or at home. Everyone is brainwashed.
The media should be rounded up and be branded traitors.  Nothing short of that is true justice for what they have done.
I'm not a Trump supporter. Never was, probably never will be, but he won fair and square. If he doesn't do a good job, people should wait 4 years and vote him away. That's why we have elections every 4 years. It sucks that they're reacting the way they are
Thank you for putting into such powerful words how so many millions of people are feeling right now.  
And yet, in the face of all of this hatred, **DONALD TRUMP WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN FOR ALL CITIZENS**  He didn't have to run and put up with all of this harassment and hate. But he is doing it, and he is doing it for all Americans. Even the ones who spit in his face.
Hey Friend,  I read the title of your post and I agree wholeheartedly... and I voted for Clinton.  "The media and my fellow Americans treat me like I am a TERRORIST because I support Trump...I am scared to show my support for Trump due to the fear of being beaten bloody, or having my belongings destroyed. When did voting... make me a terrorist? I think it's time for people to wake up..."  You hit the nail on the head.  We are all brothers, left and right.  And I am aware of the tough treatment many Trump supporters have been given.  And I just want to say, I am with you - in hoping President Trump does a great job for this country and for the world as a whole.  Peace.
Still don't feel safe putting a bumper sticker on or wearing my MAGA hat. I AM the SECRET TRUMP vote.
After reading this, I feel fortunate to live in a "red" state.   I have the right and permitted ability to defend myself at all times, a right I take very seriously.  I see what goes on and is reported and know that many people like you are trapped by this new-age McCarthy-ism that has infected society.  I pray for you all trapped behind enemy lines.
#COME ABOARD THE TRAIN  **its quite the party**
I wish everyone would've voted for trump. You know how much fun it was to be on this ride of saying "fuck you" to the establishment? We could've been a team 
Concealed Carry is highly recommended.  Stay armed; stay safe, 'pedes.
Ironically, if you are a terrorist, then the liberals will die for your freedom and good name. 
Just had a long-time friend unfriend me on FB because of this issue. She's purging everyone in a campaign to eliminate "hate" from her feed.   So she's going to create an echo chamber for herself for the next eight years. I swear - liberals learned NOTHING from this election.

###This is evidence that cultural Marxism is out in force silencing, and threatening with violence the opposition under the name of racism. So we freedom loving Americans will have to take stand fight this twisted ideology.
Instead of "Love trumps hate," their motto should be "Trump exposes hate," as all he's really done is let us see what's been hiding beneath the surface of the liberal mindset.
#Liberalism is a mental disorder.
Not meaning to be morbid here but I caught the end of a sermon on the radio today that said in the end times that "good would be portrayed as evil and evil portrayed as good" and that men and women would come part from one another. 
guys my aunt is literally attacking me on Facebook. She is losing it. I posted the Beauty and the Beast trailer and she is calling me so stupid I'd vote for a pig then 'like' a Disney movie. You can't make crap up. Liberalism is a mental disease.

Before I get down voted for the beginning of this comment, please read the whole thing before reacting. I started off as a Bernie supporter. I am firmly in the middle class, 60k a year job, family of 4, 3 bedroom house, but having a hard time saving for retirement due to high cost of living and health/dental/vision insurance.   The start of me voting Democrat was in my senior year of high school when Obama was campaigning in 08. His message of Change rang true with me, and I was blinded by the grass roots and activism. After 8 years of Obama, and seeing how some of his policy affected the working class, I wanted real change. I felt like Bernie could bring about the first noncorrupt president in a long time, but of course, the DNC couldn't let an anti-establishment candidate win, so they ruined his chances.  This made me hate the Democrats and especially the Clintons. On the other hand, most of what I had seen of trump was all negative; racist remarks, and very conservative views on things like drugs, pro-choice, and LGBT rights. I don't care about these things on a personal level, but I feel like the religious right should stay out of politics, the government has no place in our personal lives.   This left me voting 3rd party on election day, at least for the presidency, as I was disgusted by the two main options. Then Trump got elected. I started to see how the left reacted, and was disgusted. Not the actual dems in government mind you, but the voters. I payed close attention to trump after he was elected, and I agree with a most of what he has said, and am pleased to see he has softened some of his more far right policies.  A friend of mine that voted for Trump showed me a video that was simply titled "This Video Will Get Trump Elected" it shows interviews with Trump over the years, from when he was much younger and talking about how he hoped the right person to lead America came along, and that he thought he would be a good President, but didn't want to do it, all up until his speech declaring he was running.   All the things he said about trade, and our country being walked all over and screwed over by China made sense, and I realized he wasn't as crazy as I had thought, that was just the brush the media painted him with. By the end of video I had chills. Had I seen this before the election I would have backed trump 100%. But now, after all I have been seeing and hearing since his election, I am actually confident he was the right man for  the job. Now with Sanders and his supporters taking over the Democrats, we might have the first time in history where the right and left can actually work together. I know they differ on many things, and the left will fight the cutting of welfare, but, I think together, they can do a lot of great things for our country.   I hope someone reads this, as because of things like the OP talked about, I don't want to tell people I support Trump. Yet it feels so good to say it. I support Donald J Trump, and I think he can truly Make America Great Again!  TL;DR fuck you I poured my soul out, read it to MAGA!

Hillary voter and liberal here. We don't all condone the kind of violent behavior you describe. I hate to see that; there's no excuse.  I think there are probably people on both ends of the spectrum that disappoint us all. But in the middle are a lot of folks who are sensible and realize that thoughtful disagreements -- not violent ones -- are good for democracy. Looking forward to all of us meeting there.
Excellent post!  I'm tempted to share it online but would get so much backlash.  I feel the same...created a throwaway to post this because I don't want anyone to know I'm posting here.  I work in a university and people there were crying the day after the election at work.  Every day they say new things and make digs and jokes about Trump and I just laugh it off and play along.  I hate to think what they'd do/say to me if they found out how I really feel.  How can they not see their hypocrisy! They are so closed-minded and I have to remind myself they are just brainwashed and don't know any better.  They even joke about killing him and then say, "no, I shouldn't say that because then I'm no better than a Trump supporter," as if they have the moral high ground.  Then they are saying that we need better education and people voted like this because they are uneducated.  They also said people are so stupid and don't understand exit polling and that's why people lied about who they voted for and the polls were wrong and everyone was so shocked.  Not that the polls were pure BS to begin with and gee, I wonder why people might be afraid to be honest about who they voted for!?!  Seriously!!  Now on campus people are chalking and writing BS like "you are loved" and "keep on fighting" and "we know it's hard." What a crock!   It's so sad because a lot of people are terrified but for absolutely no reason at all!!  I wish there was a secret nod or handshake to identify other Trump supporters so you felt solidarity.
I can even say as a non-Trump supporter, this is absolutely embarrassing. If you wanted to protest and be disobedient, you should have at the DNC corruption. We lost, now grow the fuck up and deal with it. Start practicing what you preach with peace and equality. From an disgruntled lefty

Bro I'm in California and so far this election season I've been called racist, homiphobic, bigoted and garbage. All because I've got a trump bumper sticker which was promptly tore off a week ago by what I assume was a goblin looking degenerate who can't fathom that their subjective reality is mislead. There's a surprising amount of trump supporters on my campus but they're not vocal supporters. Needless to say, they are still heavily outnumbered by democrats.   It's just wrong that solely for my political views, these people can somehow determine my exact motivations and prejudices, and are somehow qualified to apply all of these rudimentary characteristics to me. Isn't that the definition of prejudice? To assume personal characteristics based on no evidence? And these are the same people who've hollowed out the term Liberal, and made an absolute mockery out of it. The ideology of open mindedness and willingness to see things from a different perspective. How fucking ironic.
If I came out as a Trump supporter, I would literally lose my job the next day. And although they're my main income, I'm technically a freelancer, so I would have no recourse. They'd just invent some bullshit, and I'd be gone.  My FB feed is full of people I work with demonising Trump supporters, while calling for all kinds of atrocities to be visited on them, and how the rules of democracy need to be changed.   It's so ironic how they call us Nazis, when they're the ones reading straight out that playbook.
Thinking more about this, it is exactly what the   #SorObamAlinsky   movement wanted!!! For us to start tearing each other apart.  And for what. Transgender bathrooms?   Don't give up!  Keep exposing them for who they are.   **The thing they fear the most is the TRUTH!**
The fear baiting and propaganda this year has been pretty disgusting, and it's got everyone too worked up. Unfortunately it's all too common in American politics; you may recall the post election rhetoric about Obama (socialist, Muslim gonna destroy 'Murica, etc), or GWB (literally worse than Hitler).  I'd like to see Sanders and DNC leadership come out and calm their base down. However, next cycle I hope we'll all remember how harmful this kind of rhetoric is to our society and refrain from participating in it when directed at the other side. 
 Hey /u/UnicornMoonPie,   This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
A Mexican laborer came into my place of work today (gas station) The reason I say he's Mexican is because he is from Mexico and only works seasonally in my state so I see him for only 6 months of the year. He always comes in and trys to get the other clerks to give him a free soda from the cooler because he is a regular. He's only a regular because before I worked there someone apparently did let him get away with it, among other things they would let other illegal immigrants get away with. All they ever bought was cigarettes so it wasn't like they were truckers who buy 500-1000 dollars in gas on a fill up and get a large coffee or soda for the road.   Guy comes in today and just grabs the soda out of the cooler and begins walking for the door. All he said was "BILL, TRUMP"  I responded with **IM CALLING INS**  Guy drops it and bolts out the door.   I get lectured by three people who threaten to call the police **ON ME**   I might get fired by the end of the day (lots of complaints, people called to complain about how racist I am to customers) but I too am tired of this shit. If I do get fired I will be getting a lawyer. Sorry this is just a stupid story about me but your post kinda spoke to me, thanks OP. I feel a little better.   Edit: Didn't get fired, just got told not to let that customer shop there anymore. My boss is already pissed off that these things were happening in the past without her knowledge. Said she didn't care about the complaints, she knows me better than to be a racist, even if I am a "nimble navigator". She enjoys Reddit as well.   
I can't say I agree with everything said here but I'm trying to be more of an offensive listener. This election put a huge divide between my nuclear family and I could not be more upset about that. What's become clear is that the Democrats fucked over their voting base. So much so, that I just changed from Democrat to Independent. Having a hard time jumping aboard The Donald express as I have 2 daughters and 2 sons. Character is important too me. I can, and am working to get out of my echo chamber and listen without defending. I have forgotten that it takes both sides to continue to make America great. Anyway, I know there are rules on this subreddit and if I broke them, sorry.  So much passion on both sides. wouldn't it be grand if we could take passion from both sides and parlay it into an America like no one could envision? I will continue to work with ALL my brothers and sisters to continue to make sure the USA is the envy of the modern world and is written by historians as how a country should be ran. Anyway, just a rant. thx for reading.
I'm a leftist. I voted for Clinton. But I never thought I would enjoy watching my party lose this much.  Fucking SJWs. 
I was not willing to come out as a Trump voter before the election, and I sure as hell won't do it now.  I live in the liberal lion's den of Northern Virginia.  I would be ostracized at work and in my neighborhood.  The left are the ones who are bigoted and intolerant.  
This is so well written and exactly how I'm feeling as well. You're not alone. 
No one in the media will answer your challenge. You know why? They're too busy counting up every Facebook post in which some kid claims to have been harassed/mocked and writing articles about how "Racial Hate Incidents Have Spiked Since Trump's Win."  They've already decided who's in the wrong here.
Me too. Even my former stepfather who I had a good relationship with seems to think I'm a racist and a sexist now. It's insane!! That said, he was never very smart if I'm going to be honest. Otherwise good guy though.
At some point we can no longer be defined as the villains, when the 'heroes' are destroying everything they claim to protect.
it's propaganda. Aimed at recruiting the weak willed. Alienating and isolating anyone who is left with a spine.
Every centipede is like family to me.  We're all we've got. Being a centipede isn't about shit posting. It's more than that.  It means you're someone who's not afraid to stand up for what's right and fight for what you believe in against all odds.  Those are the mother fuckers I want standing next to me when shit gets deep. Those are the mother fuckers who make this country go round.  Those are the mother fuckers I'm proud to say I had the privilege to know.  Those mother fuckers are centipedes and guess what - We run shit now.
As a democrat, this disgusts me. I've seen my Facebook feed filled with hatred towards Trump supporters and it is truly disgusting.  Not a single person sees their hypocrisy. It's sad. It really is. They all say "respect and kindness will get us through this" but the second someone says they voted for trump, they flip. It's like they're against cults but they are one themselves. It truly bothers me. Stay strong guys. I may not believe in some things that you guys believe in but I believe in unity. And god damn do you guys have that.
We are here with you, the silent, patient majority.  Waiting to be heard and given voice.
I wonder if the media understands the silent trump vote now...

I feel you. I live in LA and am terrified my true political beliefs will be found out. With open minded people I tell them I'm libertarian but would never say I supported Trump. So that's twice I've told people that I'm libertarian.   Not a lot of open minded people out here. Diversity of everything but thinking differently.  With most everyone else I tell them I supported Bernie and Jill or I act like I don't really follow politics.   One one hand, I am totally undercover and people will actually listen to what I say and think about politics. It allows me to plant the seeds of doubt, subtley.  On the other hand, it sucks. I sort of know what being in the closet is like. Actually, it'd be way easier to come out to my friends if I were gay.  I'm not afraid of violence against me so much as losing friends and employment opportunities.
Sorry to hijack but the guys over at are r/crypto have pointed out wiki insurance hash files aren't matching from Assange. Some of our more tech oriented people may want to start a thread and brief the rest of us. 
I lost a couple not-so-close friends over this election prior to election day.  Since election day, I've lost at least the same number of friends, and probably have a few more who've simply silently turned against me.  The media's emotional rhetoric is having a real, palpable effect on my life and I'm pissed.

It's crazy that I am supposed to be ashamed and embarrassed that I voted for THE President Elect
In 8 years Obama, as leader of the Democratic Party, managed to lose:  The White House, Senate, House, most governorships, most state legislatures, and the ability to tilt the Supreme Court. He also left a DNC rife with corruption. Nancy Pelosi is now the top Democrat. Definition of decimated.   As leader of the Free World, he left histories largest refugee crisis, a Middle East in flames, Islamic fascism spreading through dozens of countries, and a weaker America to lead the way out.   Obama and Hillary hollowed out the Democratic Party to create personality cults. Now as their last act, they try to physically intimidate. It won't work. Be patient. Be fair. New leadership is coming.

The left projects its sins on others. 
They've made every label meaningless now. Sticks and stones may break our bones but we have all the: memes, guns, heart, courage, fortitude, GUNS, morality, love, passion, strength, and we also have something worth fighting for. That's why they'll lose, folks..they have weak souls
I will never forget this lady at a trump ralley being surrounded protesters holding other countries flags screaming and throwing eggs at her. After I saw this is and other videos I was afraid to go to a trump rally without my husband. Trump was here in Arizona 6 times I only went to one because my husband had to work during the others. Let that sink in as a woman I am afraid to go to a public event to support my candidate in the middle of a major city in the daytime without a male escort. I feel like we have gone backwards as a country.   https://youtu.be/EwXlW_rm0Rs
its called Psychological Projection and the left are masters at it.
I lost friends and my sister was terribly angry. I don't give a fuck. Those Clintons and Obama were selling the country out from under us! 
PREACH BROTHER

#HORRID MEDIA
1) Buy a gun  2) lift weights  3) learn to fight 4) find other people that do 1-3  
The main street media executives and decision-makers who pushed this divisive and destructive narrative across our great country should be held to account.  They should be fired and publicly ridiculed for this bullshit.
Beautifully put.   This isn't "Love Trumps Hate" this is "Fear Us Or Else".   
You are one amazingly based fellow American. I support you. We just want to MAGA in peace. Respect the laws. Make a difference. Be a positive change for our country. 
THIS POST IS THE REAL ISSUE AT HAND!! PLEASE KEEP THIS STICKIED! CTR TRYING HARD TO HIDE THIS.
Too right. It's kind of a cliche now but coming out as a Trump supporter was harder and made me more afraid than coming out as queer.
Wear the MAGA hat like you are walking into an Alabama school in the 60s while getting hit with a firehose.
Must have made /r/all because the trolls here have been off the charts. Precious little triggered snowflakes have been coming in here in droves.   Deport them out.
I disagree with Trump on many issues, and I definitely wanted Hilary to win the election. Peaceful, as in no one is harmed, protest is also good in my opinion when people don't like the current direction of the country (which I personally do not either). However, what the fuck is with people hating on Trump supporters like that? Violence is not the answer; hating fellow Americans for their vote is not the answer! The people attacking other Americans and filming it are literally the terrorists in this situation. Calling all Trump voters racists or calling all liberals terrorists will just further divide the country though, and violence on either side only leads to further tension. No one should have to be so in the closet for their political opinion as long as they know what they are talking about, either. It's shit that happens. It's happened to me too. At the hospital I volunteer at I am afraid to tell any of the nurses my political opinions because they are so pro-Trump... I usually just pretend to agree with them and try to change the subject.
Seriously man, I would have had a Trump bumper sticker on my car all campaign, but its simply not worth getting my car keyed, and I even live in Texas.
This is the strategy of the Nazi party, George Soros is responsible for finding jews to turn them into the Gestapo.  He's very well experienced on Nazi operations and propaganda.  If Clinton won, we would have been entering a dark dark time, which is why I think God had a hand in this election.
This. This is why I [left the SJW community](http://ex-sjw-resource.tumblr.com/). This is why I cannot view liberal politics as positive anymore. The extreme left is dangerous in that it cannot see past its own [purity culture](http://curlicuecal.tumblr.com/post/151727038535/thoughts-on-purity-culture) and sense of cosmic righteousness.  It's dangerous, disgustingly dangerous.

This fear is something that liberals have been supposedly fighting against for years.  Now they're the ones causing it.
Right there with you. I live in city where despite what the census says whites are the minority. I voted for the person I felt was best suited to take office and now I'm the enemy despite nobody but my wife and a few friends knowing who I voted for. It's amazing how openly racist and judgmental people are being. 
This is Joy Behar. Today on live television she called Milo Yiannopoulos (flamboyant gay who likes black guys) a racist homophobe. Don't be Joy Behar, never go full leftist.

LOL I THINK SHES THE RACIST HOMOPHOBE 
At this point you can tell they don't do their own investigative reporting and only go off of the recycled talking points.   It's like a bad game of telephone where Soros starts a rumour, and as more journalists spread it without checking facts, the story gets even more outrageous.
Joy behar is a homophobe
She's often confused.
My girlfriend has been begging her mother to quit watching that shit, and I hope she eventually does. She's anti-Trump, but any time she attacks him to me (on gay rights, pushing violence) I correct her, and she knows that I know what I'm talking about, but watches this shit, and is fear mongered into more shit by these assholes 
Bitch
Shrill and abrasive retard would be an accurate way to describe this repulsive Sasquatch. 
And here I thought Whoopsie had sewn up Dope of the Year honours when she said she couldn't tell the difference between Trump's administration and The Taliban...Jesus, you can't fix stupid, can you?  As a Friday bonus, here's Omarosa and her cruel burn on "Joy" this past week...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8rq7_uyMn4#t=3m15s).  Watch the whole thing after the fire at the end...it's quite clear they hate each other.
How can a gay guy be a homophobe?  I'm confused.

If you get your news from a comedian, then your point of view is a joke. 
Disgusting   Joy Behar is a homophonic anti Semite.
Why are leftist women such cunts... I mean show me one that isnt.    
She said she doesnt respect any woman who voted for Trump. Well I don't respect her either because she's a vindictive bitch. They invite conservatives on their show to try and humiliate them and give them lectures
By that logic, she's a sexist, anti-semite. Motion to change her first name to "Misery". 
While I'm not a Milo fanboy as I think he says things that are a bit too much sometimes (not bad by any means just better left unsaid). I repect who he is and what he has to say.

Joe Dirt called. He wants his wig back.
reba wannabe 
Just go watch omarosa on the view, she wrecked joy behar so harshly.
I have been taxed with the duty of watching The View almost everyday (I work in a extremely liberal university hospital).  These people are the most uneducated supposed "educated " people I have had the discomfort to listen to. Im not solely basing this on differences of opinion. They literally vomit lies to an ever-lapping audience. My personal favorite was their describing of assault weapons. They have no idea what semi-automatic means. (They honestly believe that they are all fully automatic  .50 caliber weapons.) Adding to the utter stupidity of there target audience. They went on to describe that right wingers use these weapons for hunting animals. To which Whoopi said that it was *paraphrase* "Just an excuse to have a weapon and that she knows this because after an animal is shot with a semi-automatic weapon there is nothing left of the animal." Cue my eye roll as I watch 50 people in the cafeteria nodding their heads in agreement. 
Not to go against the bandwagon but he's said being gay is unnatural, and if he could cure himself of it he would.  Being gay isn't a choice, so it's pretty feasible to hate gays while being gay. He absolutely could be a homophobe.  Kinda like an...Uncle Ruckus story.
Lol someone told her right after "he's also gay " and her response was "so what"
53% upvoted with almost 15k upvotes. Lol they try and try to keep us down but we just keep fucking winning!
The View is a show for idiots, by idiots.  I mean, who is home in the middle of the day wasting their time watching TV?
I'm sure that got a huge applause from the hard working people who are home all day watching tv.
I upvoted everybody most of you are still at 0.  Weird. 
Liberalism is cancer.
This show is an embarrassment to all women. The more inaccurate and retarded statements from the hosts, the more the audience applauds, it's nauseating. Watching it persuades me to believe that women shouldn't be allowed to vote and I'm female. 
I lost a close friend of 7 years here in Portland for not voting for Hillary.   She consistently called me a misogynist.   She knew I voted for Stein.   She works fairly high up for the government.  How can you deal with that mentality?   I have lost all respect for anyone who calls themselves a Democrat.   The majority are too stupid to even have a conversation with,  much less a debate.   And it's not like I'm a Republican.   They are hell bent on losing the support of every free thinking or progressive person on all sides.   Being a radical moderate is the new minority.  There needs to be a viable third party. 
Good thread to post one of my favorite videos. Kelly Osborne lets her true racist colors out on the view   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0TFayRZeS8
I don't understand how we can be beaten by a mob of people who are also looting, rioting, setting fires, and breaking shit just because we are trying to speak, and the media STILL PORTRAYS US AS THE BAD GUYS.
This is what happens when you are an old, lonely liberal who doesn't like men (gay or straight men...you just hate men). 
They are seriously the laziest ass holes ever.  I bet 99% have never taken the time to listen to one of his many speeches youtube before screaming Nazi.   
The entire show she's on, the View, is an incredibly misinformed shithole. My own mom (Hillary voter unfortunately) has refused to watch it for a long time, after years of slurping it down like it was candy.   They're reactionary to the point of ludicrousness, Goldberg is a continually inflammatory has-been pretending to be relevant, and in general they're borderline man-haters. It really is pretty disgusting. 
Didn't she already have to apologize for something outrageously off base this election season? Why is she on TV?
Joyless lefturd continues to sink lower in the ratings and closer to the exit. 
Soulless prune.
HIS BOYFRIEND IS LITERALLY BLACK! MILO IS ACTUALLY GAY!  The mental gymnastics these people use is just insane!
I am sure she is just being spoon fed her info like everyone else who hates milo and has no fucking clue who he actually is.
The left's treatment of the Jewish sucker of black-cocks has clearly demonstrated their hypocrisy.
Make daytime TV great again! Single moms have been indoctrinated by this shit for decades.
BAWWWK-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk!  That's what I hear every time she opens her stupid mouth.
going full Behtard 
A gay homophobic man? What?
Recognizing this prattling yenta isn't worth this great sub's time. The noise emitted from her mouth hole can only be heard by doofuses.
Milo: *Protestant Christians are retarded. It is a disease that is spreading*  Liberals: ..........  Milo: *Transgendered people are retarded*  Liberals: **FUCKING RIGHT-WING BIGOT! HATE SPEECH! HATE SPEECH!!!**
What a dumb bitch!
a racist homophobe lol, god this level of retardation is hard to achieve.
I will never have another erection, thanks a lot for this picture...
You never go full Behar.
The View is THE BIGGEST DUMPSTER FIRE on tv. Disgusting. On ABC, of course.   ##NASTY WOMEN
Once one of my friends (who did not know I was gay) called me a homophobe for expressing the opinion that homosexuality is unnatural, even though I followed it up by saying "and there's nothing wrong with that". When I told them I was gay they couldn't understand how a gay person could have an opinion outside of the general hivemind. From my experience it's usually middle-class white girls trying to 'stick up' for gay people. It's like bitch please you're causing conflict when there needn't be any by labelling people like that. They love labelling people because it lets them divide them up and the left LOVES dividing people.
This is depressing. Freedom of speech or freedom of retardation?
He said that Milo liking blacks doesn't prove that he likes blacks.   Just ignore the triggers for a moment and think about that.
oh yes the very rare gay, Jewish, British immigrant with a black boyfriend who hates gays and other races. 
This is the one who said Bill's rape victims were asking for it right?
She is a complete disaster... don't pay her ANY MIND.
A gay jew who loves black cocks is racist? I swear liberals are losing any sense of sanity by the second.
The man loves fat black cocks; how, seriously, how can he be a racis, homophobe?
You know, it's rare that I upvote something from this sub, but take my upvote, buddy. That's just idiotic. 
I don't think Joy Behar is a leftist. She's just an idiot.
DAE think she looks like bill Maher in a wig?
Was there someone there to counter argue???
Was the picture really necessary?  I need some...  # EYE BLEACH
She looks like a clown
God these people are mentally ill.  Do some research before you vomit out fake information.
These people have no fucking idea what they're talking about. This was probably the first time she heard his name. 
I dont know much about whoopi's political opinions but what she said at the end was pretty based. Those fucking retards DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO DESTROY SHIT.
To be fair he is pretty harsh on homosexuality. Not stating my opinion on his opinions. Just something i have seen.
God that show is nothing but a bunch of clucking chickens
It's insane none of these people bother digging any deeper than typing "Milo Yiannopolous is a..." into Google.  Even a modicum of research would reveal these accusations to be untrue. 
Lol. Wow. You really can't make this shit up. What a stupid cunt. 
\#YouKeepUsingThoseWords.    \#IDoNotThinkThoseMeanWhatYouThinkTheyMean.
I didn't think it was possible.... but the left is FINALLY collapsing in on itself.   This should be blasted to her higher-ups.   She is pure trash.  
Reliable sources are telling me that Joy Behar smells like tuna
Joy Blowhard from The View is a narcissist who is unqualified to be on Television.
I've tried to write out several different responses saying how disgusting it is that she chooses this level of mental deficiency and ignorance, but I can only wind up back at a singular answer: What a fucking t**t-waffle
Milo should do The View. That would be the best television ever. 
Beady close set eyes
Come on Joy..can't you just take maybe 5 minutes to do a little research. Before you open your big fat mouth?? You are so Wrong wrong wrong.. beyond stupid. 
Goddamn.  Wouldn't you at least TRY to research the topics you report on if you're a journalist?  I mean these statements are so easily disproven, it's like she was fed her lines by some unseen actor.  *also this unseen actor is a fucking idiot who thinks everyone is trapped in the 1930's with only one source of information and no means of verifying the bullshit they spew.
God, this show is like mainlining a toxic cocktail of stupidity and hate.
The View is the worst television program I've ever seen in my life.
lmfao what a fucking retard  Milo has a black boyfriend. 
How fucking autistic can you get
I like how the left downvote the shit out of any T_D posts and when they downvote this it means they are homophobes.
So genuinely not trying to concern troll or anything, but I watched Milo on Sargon's stream once and I kinda agree.  He's gay yeah, but unless it's satire I didn't get, he genuinely believes lesbians don't exist.  Also (admittedly they were both drunk) he was being pretty fucking racist, just because he's fucks black dudes doesn't necessarily mean he respects them.  But then again, I have VERY little exposure to Milo.
This is the result of reflexively labeling people, just because you disagree with them.  After a while all the name calling becomes a blur and they don't even know what they are saying anymore.  You can't make this stuff up.

Trey Gowdy Fights Back Tears On His First Day Back In Congress Where He Warns Anyone Who Interferes With His Child Exploitation Investigation Will Be Forced To Show Up & Explain Publicly Why They Are Obstructing It
We need to clone this man.  If we had a Congress full of Gowdy's this country couldn't be stopped.
Listen to this DOJ representative admit she was prohibited by the Obama admin from asking for more funds to pursue child exploitation investigations (at ~58:30) -   https://youtu.be/2PtjmTrBLUQ?t=3416  
Gowdy probably saw first hand the crimes against humanity these people are committing.
Love this man.  He is a skilled a fighter as we have in the battle of good vs. evil.  
The fact that this is being downvoted to hell means that Shareblue and Brock's pizza boys are targeting this. As it is THE TRUTH.
The investigation is ongoing under veil, things like this prove it.

Rowdy Gowdy might be the most based politician not named Donald Trump.

Holy shit this is hard to watch. Can someone who lives out of state donate to a campaign? I'll support a guy who gives a shit and stands by his words. 
Unrelated, kinda, but my gf was watching an episode of "Forensic Files" before bed, and I was about to sleep until this man appeared on TV to discuss the case. Only episode I really watched. 
The circle is closing. 
This guy has a heart of gold. People like Gowdy are why people dream about becoming prosecutors. This man exemplifies the legal profession and what it means to be American in his morality, honesty, and vigor. Couldn't have more respect for this man. 
Any stupid cuck that blocks this investigation should be thrown in jail immediately. You're messing with kid's lives here.
Anyone downvoting this is mentally ill

Love this man. He's so pure hearted.
Pedos obstructing lists of potential child abuse victims? There is a Czar for that.
This man warms my heart every tine I hear him talk. Maybe Gowdy for 2024 or 2028 president ? May god protect him from those pedos. If he commits "suicide" in the next year it will only prove for real, that there's a pedophile ring in the elites.

Anyone have any details about what this hearing is in reference to and what the goal of it is?
Molly coddling of sex offenders and other violent criminals is high up there on the list of why I'm no longer a Democrat.   I had porn made of me when I was 10. It is a lifetime mindfuck not knowing what is out there, wondering if disgusting animals are using it for their sick pleasure  or worse,  to groom other kids.

If you pray or do that sort of thing, pray for this guy and his team, I am sure they are and already have seen some of the most horrific things and this stuff will mess up any persons mind.

How rampant is pedophilia in out government? Jesus Christ it's sick
I absolutely love Gowdy.
**TRUE PATRIOT**
Pedos put on notice, if Hollywood is capable of being more anti-Trump it will be now.
He makes the pen mightier than the sword, but goddamn it's boring and takes a long time.  I want all these pedos shot in publican live streamed
Oh shit  Explains why McCain is suddenly acting senile 
One of the very, very, very, VERY few men or women in our government that I have a high level of trust in with regards to their moral and ethical compass.

65% down voted speaks VOLUMES!  The Pedos in power are worried.
Happy with Sessions, but boy would he have made a killer AG. 
So people on Reddit hate Donald Trump so much, that when a man who is not Donald Trump leads a fight against pedophilia, they downvote the shit out of it? Its at 59% right now. Liberalism = mental illness
He's so entertaining. I feel bad for any defendants who had to go up against him as a prosecutor. 
What exactly is he talking about?  What "providers" are refusing to work with who exactly?  (Serious quesiton--not sure what he is working on here.)
Watch this: [Child Star from The Goonies exposes the major Pedophilia problem in Hollywood.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvlle8qQag8)  My guess is Washington is just as bad. This is a real problem people would just rather pretend it doesn't exist!  
I don't know this man. I don't know if he's republican or democrat and frankly I don't care. I want him front and center. We need more people like him holding public office. 
***Here we go!!*** 
I get goosebumps when Mr. Gowdy speaks. This is a true lawman who loves this country and the people in it. This pedo shit HAS to end. Even if it tears the world apart.  
Good video but lacks context, would be nice to have a long form version.
If you downvoted this you deserve to be called a pedophile and child abuse supporter.
>Why are you obstructing an investigation into child molestation and rape?  The question every Clinton fears. 
Assholes on r/all please explain to me why you are down voting this?
FUCK YOU if you downvote anything related to potential child exploitation. We need to get to the bottom of this, all politics aside. Where's your fucking soul?
I want him as president.  After 8 years of course.
Trey gowdy has proven that he is 100% a man of integrity 
I hope whatever shitty amount of $$ they are paying the shills downvoting this are worth it. Because YOU are against children. Children being abused, raped, and people trying to raise awareness/do something about it. Makes me honestly sick.   
56% upvote for this   reddit a cesspit 
Compare the like/dislike ratio on the actual video to the 55% upvote on this post. It's SO obvious that we're being brigaded by people who don't even watch the video.
This is a man your sons can look up to.
Hell yeah, fuck anyone who advocates for those sick mother fuckers. 
just the other day I wished for the future where all the people opposing this movement are themselves deemed as pedos. once again, thanks trey. 
This is the only member of Congress that makes me second guess my support for Term Limits. 
I support this as a moderate who leans liberal. 
How in the FUCK is this 57% upvoted?! I'm usually not surprised by the left, but GODDAMN. 
We may disagree politically but as a father this is something we all need to be behind and supporting. Thank you Gowdy.

About time, bring these monsters down on both sides of the isle. 
Get back to us when there are some **ARRESTS**.
Trey is the man. Total bad-ass defender of truth, justice and freedom.  THIS is a role model.  
It's happening....the filthy fucks are going down.  
Interesting that this is happening only now. Was Gowdy not allowed to investigate child exploitation during the previous administration? Were pedophiles being protected under that previous president? Did a certain new president finally take the shackles off and tell him to go after these scumbags?
CAN'T DELAY THE TREY 
It makes me sick to think that there are actual human beings who lifted their finger to click the downvote arrow for this. PEDOPHILE LIVES DO NOT MATTER. 
Pedophiles. The lot of them. Kill anyone who supports Pelosi.
Love this man and support his cause 100%.  Anyone that doesn't support prosecution of these sick fucks no matter who they are is an accomplice.
Thank you Mr. Gowdy. Seriously, thank you.
You know, if there was a post on here where a Trump supporter/republican legitimately discovered the cure to cancer, it would still be 50% upvoted. You're a joke, reddit.
Why would you EVER downvote this? Even if you absolutely despise trump and his staff?
Gowdy is such a fucking beast. Listening to him always gives me goosebumps. Go get 'em Gowdy.
#(55% upvoted)  Fucking disgusting!
Can the people who downvoted this come forward and explain publicly why they needed to downvote this? The FUCK is wrong with you. 
Holy shit
**When Trey Gowdy was speaking, these were the words I heard being stated:**  *Today the LORD will conquer you, and I will kill you and cut off your head. And then I will give the dead bodies of your men to the birds and wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel!*
#HOW THE FUCK ARE PEOPLE DOWN VOTING THIS?  Take a good hard look in the mirror Reddit
ShariaBlue pedos downvoting.   Fucking burn. 
56% upvoted. Shariablue employee.. wtf is wrong with you?  do you like child molestation? 
This man is so based he neutralizes even the hashest of acids
And reddit is downvoting this, fuck those cucks
Trey Gowdy is a boss.
Fucking love Trey...

Never let this fight die. There are evil, child abusers in our government, and they must be stopped.
The reasons they get blocked are national security, governments will fall, even royal families (including British) and also the Vatican.

**LOOK AT ME, I'M THE MANUFACTURER NOW**
this news is coming from a website that a month ago said the pope was endorsing trump.  THIS IS FAKE guys.
Bring me a source that doesn't look like a blatantly fake news site, please.
Not to get your hopes up, but Apple is simply looking at the possibilities of moving, not actually planning a move. So, it's entirely possible that Apple will not move to the United States.   Also, there's really no economic benefits of Apple moving to the United States. Obviously, there's the wage issues. In China, a worker is paid $30 a day to build an iPhone. In the United States, it's about $12 per hour. That means, in an average work day, which is 8 hours, it would cost $96. Three times what it costs in China. This does not mean the cost of the iPhone will not go up, as Apple is already charging the maximum amount a customer would pay for an iPhone. However, it would mean it would hurt the revenues of Apple. This means that Apple, unless it has some benefits like tax subsidies, won't move manufacturing back to America.  Also, the manufacturing itself is a small scale operation. In the process of building an iPhone, most of the work comes from designing in California, and building components from factories in United States, South Korea and Japan. Factories in China are simply putting the parts into place, like building a Lego set. So even if Apple were to bring manufacturing back into the US, it would employ a small number of people.   Furthermore, Apple is already using robots to replace half of the Chinese workers in China. Soon, it is possible most of the work in manufacturing an iPhone will be given to robots. So, if Apple were to relocate manufacturing back to the US, not many people will be hired because of robotics and automation. I think Adidas relocated their factory back to Germany from China because they automated their manufacturing process.   Also, the factory won't be located in Rust Belt states, where the demand for manufacturing jobs are high. It will be probably be located in California, close to their HQ and Pacific ports, since a large part of their market is in Asia.   As for the threat of tariffs on goods manufactured in China, they will simply move operations to Vietnam, or any other Asian countries that will have large manpower with low wages. If Trump wants to put high tariffs on every goods that are not manufactured in the United States, that's an economic suicide for him.   In conclusion, the manufacturing jobs will never return to the United States unless it is automated. This isn't the 1950s anymore, where a person can graduate from high school, work in a factory, join a union and receive enough wages to enjoy a middle class lifestyle. The factories of the 21st Century will be automated, and hire small number of college graduates who can repair the sophisticated robots, program them, and manage the automated manufacturing process.   If you want to hold Apple accountable, get them to pay back the backed up taxes from foreign accounts they have overseas. Then close those loopholes so they can't evade taxes.   My advice to all of you is stop hoping that manufacturing jobs will return like they were in the fifties. If you want to work in factories again, go to college and get degrees in computer science, robotics, or engineering.    
#CNN: TRUMP PUTS THOUSANDS OUT OF WORK
They've actually already been doing this for a year or two- the first product line brought back to the USA was the cylindrical Mac Pro. Don't think its really a matter of politics so much as they're sick of leaks helping China turning out clones of their shit before the real thing can even hit market

I hope they figure out a way 
#WE HAVE THE BEST APPLES FOLKS
#ARE YOU TIRED OF WINNING YET?
Why haven't we done this in the last 8 years?  Because no one was speaking for Americans. Even if Apple stays in China, the change in our culture will finally put our own people first, and the shift in mindset is already apparent.   
If this happens I'll get MAGA tattooed on my ass. And I still won't be tired of winning 
Steve Jobs told Obama: "Those jobs aren't coming back."
**BUT THE LEFTISTS DON'T WANT TO DO A JOB. THEY JUST WANT FREEEE GOODS**
Imagine what he'll accomplish when he is actually sworn in as president.
They got very wealthy at the cost of American jobs. Time to come home. 
Don't mind me, I'm just observing more shit being done in the last few weeks than has been done in 8 years. 
While this is great, this is technically misleading. The company that assembles iPhones is studying the viability of moving to the USA. This would be huge though.
Payments for working payments will rise, but thats good since people should have a livable wage. And in the West we shouldn't compete with slave labour that can't join a union because of communism.
If they do this ill start buying their products again  Even better knowing android is from google, and windows from microsoft
If it happens, the hardware is only going to be put together in the US, all the internals will still be made in China. Still good news though.
Manufacturing jobs are very vulnerable to automation especially with a large corporation like Apple. No way they'll pay a US worker's rate with their current human labor needs.
> “Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double,” the source said.  Apple could keep the cost constant and still make a profit
Apple is bringing back Jobs.....
#SUCK MY DONGLE
Come on mods, this website looks so sketchy! I have a hard time believing this.
Did they finally realise you can't take jobs away from the very people that buy your product? Money doesn't grow on trees.
Wait... did anyone posting in here actually read the article?
You know why? Why all these foreign leaders are bending the knee and shit's getting done? Because they KNOW Trump isn't soft like Obama, and that he's a threat to them. They can't be complacent anymore. Obama thought the way to negotiations and progress was gentleness, but all it did was create complacency. My aunt is visiting - she doesn't speak English very well, but she took one look at Trump during all this presidential news and she said "this man knows how to lead." EVEN A LITTLE OLD ROMANIAN LADY GETS IT. He's exuding authority and people respect that. 
I don't know if we should be upvoting shit like this. it's not a shitpost, just a garbage article from a garbage source.  > “Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double,”  >  some in the Apple supply chain said it would be impossible to move iPhone production back to the U.S. due to a lack of infrastructure and a steep hike in costs.  > America simply did not have enough skilled workers for the production of iPhones  It's completely, 100% impossible. The infrastructure isn't here. Even at 2X the cost, they couldn't do it.
And all the poor wittle sjws will complain about paying more for their designer IPhones.  "I don't care if it creates jobs or spurs the economy I want muh iPhone on the low low!"
#I MIGHT JUST GET AN IPHONE, FUCK GOOGLE 
I'd switch to Apple tomorrow if they moved all production to the u.s.
If Apple is forced to manufacture in America, their overhead will increase, but since the previous cost of their products has already been normalized with consumers, raising prices would turn many off. To stay relevant, they would be forced to lower their corporate profit. Lowering their corporate profit will weaken their globalist reach.  Trump's mantra doesn't refer to only politics, but also corporations... DRAIN THE SWAMP!!
I was already hating Googles shilling and liking Apples stance on privacy.  I will pay $100 more for an American made phone and will gladly buy my first Apple device ever.
i cant take all this winning 
>The anxiety among Trump’s mostly white working-class supporters in the Rust Belt of America is understandable   so sick of this shit. Stop making everything about race you assholes. 
Let's hope Apple is serious about this, but I suspect it's more to remind the Chinese who holds the leverage in their relationship and to quit making idle threats about shutting down production.  I'm sure Apple execs weren't pleased with China's chest thumping which could scare off investors and hurt their share price - if I were on their board I'd tell the ChiComs to knock that shit off in a very public fuck-you kind of way... and it looks like this announcement is exactly that.
He is not even in power yet.  Is every good thing from now on going to be attributed to Trump and the bad things maybe left over from Obama?  Thought so, carry on. 
This has no source lol..

CNN: Trump is robbing jobs from the 3rd world! 
[removed]
[removed]
Is there a source for this information outside of northcrane.com?
If they move everything to the u.s I'll be forced to trade my waterproof s5 in for a new iPhone whatever.   
From the article:  "According to research company IHS Markit, it costs about $225 for Apple to make an iPhone 7 with a 32GB memory, while the unsubsidized price for such a handset is $649."  So, if the cost doubles to $450 Apple is still getting $199 a handset.  Apple will still enjoy one of the highest margin businesses in the world.
Not even sworn in and a major company is considering moving back to America. This is only going to MAGA. 
I want those protestors who are bitching and moaning to sign a contract that they will not receive any of the BIGLY benefits that will continue to come to us thanks to the Lord Emperor.
If Trump made a deal where if apple brings at least 60% of its production to the US they get a 5% reduction on corporate tax, it would go down in history forever and change unemployment and the value of the US manufacturing industry. 
Even if they do build automatic production plants, it will still employee a shit ton of people.
I don't own any apple products, but would consider it if they were American made. I'd pay extra for that.
I saw somewhere that the cost could increase 14% to manufacture here. Can someone explain to me where other savings would come in to offset those expenses? I bet that a favorable tax rate, shipping costs etc. other factors I have no experience with would offset some of the costs of manufacturing in the states. 
Question, wouldn't this mean more automated jobs instead of people being employed? I guess as long as people are employed to maintain the machines and stuff, it's still a net win. 
I love you guys. I really do. I signed up right before the election so ill never pretend to have taken part in the original Push for Maga. But, im here now and forever. I love you all.  
Thats because conditions are going to become more favorable for businesses here. Also, that repatriating of money, it's going to happen. And Tim Cuck was supporting Hillary. These fucking leftists.
#AHEAD  #OF  #SCHEDULE
I mean, if this happens then holy shit YES
This can't happen. There's no way the cost can be justified for Apple, unless Trump lowers minimum wage or taxes the shit out of companies not manufacturing in the U.S (not sure if that's even legal). Anyone have a explanation as to how this could happen? Am I missing something?
We all know apple is only doing this so they can blame Trump, and charge $5000 for a macbook.   "we can't abuse humans in third world countries anymore we have to pay a fair wage to Americans its not fair so deal with the price"  I hate them, and I own an iphone.
that's great if it ever happens... and hopefully along with it that whole "made in the USA" tag wouldn't take a hit in quality as a result.
They will fill those jobs quick once President Trump cracks down on fraud, waste and abuse in the welfare programs. Once he catches all these loopholes and scammers in the system and puts them back to work, those jobs will fill up with the quickness. 
imagine, Obama was/is so TERRIBLE, that just the hint of someone with competence coming in has caused the stock market to surge past 19000 for the first time in history, made ISIS crap their pants, turn illegal immigrants around at mexico city and made business come home...  amazing what happens when you leader isnt a glorified community organizer 
Is this real life? HOLY SHIT! God Bless Trump!
#CAREFUL WE MIGHT BE LABELED EVIL NATIONALISTS!!!!  (why is that a bad thing again???)
I read on a well known apple blog that the cost difference will only be between $30 to $100 per phone ...well worth it IMO
As a /r/the_donald subscriber, I think it's funny how our posts have thousands of up votes at a 99 or 98% up vote ratio and the second it hits the front-page that number drops into the 60 and 70% range. People must not read the posts or the articles and down vote immediately. I mean, who wouldn't support moving production back to America? Do they not want jobs? 
If this happens I'll upgrade my MacBook Pro, my iPhone and probably my iMac. Especially when the products made in the USA hit store floors. 
meh. I'm bored with winning. First week after election Trump delivers 20 billion barrels of oil in my state and thousands of manufacturing jobs. 
Article says decision began before the election -- in June. How is Trump responsible?
Apple already overcharges, so they can easily eat the price increases.
Here are a few reasons why this won't happen. http://bgr.com/2016/11/16/iphone-manufacturing-china-donald-trump/
The "article" is from a Missouri graphic designer's blog. I'm sure he knows what he's talking about /s
Greatest. President. Ever.
This will likely just be all done with robots soon. That may be why they are moving back. No reason to pay workers all this money, when it can be automated almost 100% now. 
They are asking to be subsidized to be able to produce in the US. How about the greedy-ass CEOs take paycuts, or is that not an option for them?
Here at apple - we were the first company to move to the U.S. before the making-of-America-great - and we make magical products, and we love America

I feel like this is a stupid question at this point, but what does BTFO stand for again?
Well, "Designed by Apple in California; Made in America" looks a LOT nicer than "Designed by Apple in California; Made in China".
But... but... but... Hillary said that would never happen! 😭😭😭
People say things will cost more. I say an iPhone is not really worth 900 dollar for example. Things will be good for competition. 
Presidential status: Not even yet
AND YOU ARE GONNA SAY DONALD, "WE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF WINNING PRESIDENT TRUMP" BUT I AM GOING TO KEEP WINNING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. FUCK YEAH DONALD
Key thing to take note of here. People are crying saying the price of the iPhone will double. The price may double for Apple to produce, but that doesn't translate to a double retail price. They pay $225 to produce it, and let's say it costs $450 to produce here. That means the retail will go from $650 to $875 to keep the same margin or 34% higher, not 100% higher. With added technology and efficiency, the final cost may come down further. 
BUT THE ARMCHAIR ECONOMISTS IN R/REDACTED SAID MANUFACTURING JOBS WILL NEVER COME BACK
Swedish women in a wheel-chair gets gangraped by 6 refugees. Get this to the top of /r/All for awareness of the violence against women that the West has had to endure as a result of our immigration policies.
"Six men aged in their 20s were arrested in the days that followed they were later released." ಠ_ಠ
There was actually a quite (for being Sweden) large long-going demonstration by the Gotland population towards the decision of letting the suspects go free. To such an extent the police had to get reinforcements from the mainland.  The "funny" part is that the mainsteam medias started calling these protesters (regular citizens) nazis, because apparently a few nazis were indeed protesting (guilt by association obviously).  And to not go off the regular and oh-so predictable course of action: The post-colonial feminists started an anti-racism demonstration - Yes, after a wheelchair-bound swede had been gangraped by migrants who were released since she hadn't "resisted enough".  PS. had there been a public vote for closed borders in Sweden today, the would be closed. The debate climate has changed dramatically over the last 2 years, even though the mainstream media will give a ridiculous amount of publicity to sympathizers of the of open borders and post-colonial feminism (who total about 12% of the population in pretty much every poll ever made). The Sweden Democrats are even growing at a large rate amongst migrants.  TL:DR Swedish mainstream media is pretty much CNN with different names. There's always been problems with the migration in Sweden and the average Joe has always known it. What we're currently seeing in Sweden is the "last stand of modern feminism", and trust me, it will get crushed.  Sincerely A swede who's been thoroughly following the political climate in Sweden (and elsewhere) for 8+ years.
I was in a wheelchair for several months last year. You are so vulnerable... Interestingly I found that it brought out the best in people wanting to help. So for this to happen - I have no words.
In a wheelchair?    Man, when I say these people are evil, they always shock me with just *how* evil they are.  I can't believe so many shitty liberals out there think this is just "cultural enrichment".  Throw every last one of these rapist fucks in the slammer!

But Islam is true feminism. 
As much as the filthy muslim scum is responsible for this, so too are the fathers/brothers/mothers/sisters of these poor women. They sit back every day and watch their neighbourhoods falling apart and they refuse to shout out. They have no help from their own government, the government goes out of its way to refuse Islam is the problem. It's disgusting, and the peoples of the country are as much to blame as that backwards fucktard religion known as Islam.
You know why there's not more liberals posting saying wow this is pretty Fed up?   The left is so ridiculous and hysterical and hateful right now that if your caught posting anything other than "debunked" or some other snide remark on the donald, your doomed to have a bunch of prying losers run through your post history and declare everything you say as invalid based on your posting history the donald.  Most of the trump hating is based on people being pussies always searching for approval from everyone else.
No guys! Redacted said that the definition of rape is difffffferent. Maybe it was consensual and then the condom broke inside so she changed her mind /s
Here is the press release from the prosecutors' office, commenting on the decision not to proceed with the allegations:  https://www.aklagare.se/nyheter-press/pressmeddelanden/?newsId=9FEEB27F160E4BCC  EDIT: In english: No evidence of violence. Inconsistent stories from parties involved. Possibility to proceed with rape if there is proof that victim was in a helpless condition, but it is not possible to cite only disability, because it would rule out consensual sex between ppl w disabilities, and set a ridiculus presedence. Only one man admitted to have had sex with the woman, and no contradictory evidence otherwise.
Oh yes. This one.   SILENCE from the MUSLIM SHARIA MEDIA
Migrants have brought nothing but crime to Sweden: rapes & violence tripled, and it's costing them an extra $8.7 billion a year just to police.  Had to hire over 4,000 new officers. "Socialist paradise" they said.  http://www.nationaleconomicseditorial.com/2017/02/10/sweden-migrant-crime-cost/
Yea but did it happen last night?? Checkmate, racist
What the fuck i hate disabled people now! 
Shit like this needs to spread. If they're going to play the agitprop game, we need to fight back just as hard.
Shits gotten too lax lately.  Bring back the death penalty.  Hang those motherfuckers up and out in the open as an example.
Saw this on one of the other subs, someone replied with a 'snopes' link to refute it. Libs are so dumb. In spite of So many incidents they don't research, they ask for citation or it didn't happen. Some one apologized to Sweden for DJT.
You can't just gangrape a disabled woman and get away with it!? That's where you're wrong kiddo - refugee
/r/All isn't interested in the truth though.
I believe it was their "justice" system that said she didn't fight hard enough, and let the men off, not the crazy feminists, although I guess there isn't much difference at this point.
Some Swedish official will disagree with this article. Then the insane Left will have this on r/all as debunked 
Meanwhile my liberals shared fake news link and be like " see even Sweden doesn't even know what trump was talking about"  How pathetic is that? Our young generation learned the ability to read but not the ability to doubt. How can you dig the truth out if you choose to only believe the news that slide with you? 
And Swedish people still don't seem to be waking up. I was just listening to a Radio 4 programme about Trumps Swedish comments last night and Surprise Surprise they had two women from Sweden claiming they knew nothing about any rape or violence related to migrants. Why didn't they know about it? One of them admitted that she checked the papers to see if it was true and concluded that it was not. Rip Sweden.
They should really have the death penalty for this.
What tf??  These people are animals.
Also, **FUCK THE DOWNVOTING SHILLS FROM SHARIA BLUE**
Islam is cancer.
I love that liberals don't think rape is a big problem anymore.   This time last year everything was rape now rape doesn't exist😂😂😂
Fucking barbarians. I don't care who did this, or what background they are; what the fuck is wrong with those people. I hope the Canadian politicians heading to Sweden (maybe they're already there, I know the GG is going) actually take a stand, but I doubt it.

Guys, nothing bad has ever happened in Sweden. Refugees don't rape. They experience *sexual emergencies* that make them unable to not have sex.
thats insane and then they arrested them AND THEN THEY LET THEM GO.. INSANE .. ITS FUCKING INSANITY..   What will happen is that one of these women that get raped is going to be the wife or daughter of someone important like the Amsterdam Hells Angels Chapter Leader... and then Sweden is going to burn down

Is it just me or are Western European men really pathetic? If this happened here, or in another non-cucked country, like Croatia, Russia, or even India, you know there would be no question of police. Those barbarians would be lynched in the streets. Jesus Christ.
This is the new normal for Sweden.  Look at the brazenness of these people they know there are no consequences for their actions.  The video is *NOT* graphic but I dare anyone to watch it and not go into rage.  Link to the video: https://gatestone.eu/new-footage-rape/  >Yesterday, footage was released of Khodagholi bullying his victim when she was calling someone for help (police). The poor girl was barely conscious, but her rapist couldn't control himself. "You got raped. There, we have the answers. You’ve been raped," he shouted gleefully at her. He then laughed like a psychopath and continued to make fun of her.
Does this have anything to do with the based Wheelchair occupant who plowed into the muslims attacking the 60 minutes crew?
Guys relax. It was a sexual emergency.
Picking on defenseless people all the time. Muslims are fucking pussies, and I'll shoot one dead in its tracks if they try any of that here
The media is being totally unfair to Trump as usual. This is exactly the thing he was talking about, it's just that "you look at what's happening last **year** in Sweden" doesn't sound as good.
#SWEDEN IS THE RAPE CAPITAL OF EUROPE
Hang all 6 of them.
Oh my god. Upvoted for awareness.
No one cares. Everyone wants to turn a blind eye. Everyone wants to label us nazis and tell everyone else we are crazy. No one fucking cares.   I feel like I am going crazy 
I'd like their heads on spikes.
Literally raping cripples....  Feminist defense of this in 3... 2... 1...
The left doesn't care. r/all doesn't care. We must defeat them completely to make an impact.
Shame on Sweden. Their feminist government failed. 
Guys, let's not paint them all with the same brush because of one, ahem, I mean six bad apples.  Not all muslims are gang rapists!...................only some
Trying to get to the top of r/all is a pipe dream any more.
These refugees were surely in dire need of a home. The one they left was burning and their lives were threatened. They surely aren't economic migrants looking to get revenge on the west. 
> Swedish women in a wheel-chair gets gangraped by 6 refugees.  #LastNightInSweden
How is it possible for sweden to close their eyes? How is it possible to not realise you have a severe problem in your country? 
Get this one to the top guys.
How the fuck are Swedes not in the street demanding change or overthrowing their government? Time for the natives to form their own roaming street patrols with dire consequences for the refugee criminals. 
What an amazing culture. 
Those people are hopeless. I think their souls are bought and paid for by Satan and permanently lost and blind. I'm convinced we're in a spiritual battle. When you see Chelsea Clinton get almost 100K likes on Twitter for ridiculing the situation in Sweden where women are being raped and murdered by refugees, it shows just how bad things are. It's really a miracle that we won the election, but can we really make a change? I'm getting discouraged.
This stuff used to be a big concern to me but at this point it seems pretty clear most of the people in Sweden don't give a shit about rapes happening in the country, at least not to the point where they are going to vote the politicians out of office. I do feel bad for that want to take a stand but are probably scared because they will be branded as a "racist". 
What's really sad is that the feminists in Sweden did a protest about this - to support the rapists. Seems they'd rather be raped than called racist. Their country is gone, may as well call it "Swyria". I give them 3 years max and they are under Shariah law completely. Then we won't hear any more about the violence. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gOvT9dmpA4
Thank god for the second amendment. 
Wow, had no idea the Swedish were so pathetic and helpless.  What a bunch of cucks.  All they did was protest, with what, flowers and get well cards?
The MSM is banking on people agreeing with Sweden ("what!! nothing is going on!!!") because if you tell the truth you'll be accused of being a racist.  If me or someone I know is raped, I am not going to give a shit about "accidentally" telling people what race they are.  
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3831991/Wheelchair-bound-woman-gang-raped-six-migrants-Swedish-asylum-centre-asking-use-toilet.html    Someone explain how there are two identical articles dated differently?  Serious question. At first I was all on board, but this smells like a repost for clicks by the daily mail or something. It's dated 2016 October
Let's import a bunch of rapefugees, about 75%+ are males between ages 16-50. Many of which cannot speak swedish and have no money. Many of which, even though are piss poor, think they are superior to Swedes/infidels. Many of which goes to brutalize and rape people. Many of which will take advantage of your law and compassion (demanding halal foods and claiming to be under 18 years old).
mfw reddit has banned stickies, changed algorithms, updated the entire voting system, edited comments and introduced filtered subreddits, and /r/the_don is STILL unstoppable.
"Have you tried calling them racist again?"    
When our support for the President is so strong that the admins completely fuck over the website on so many occasions in a desperate bid to silence our side of the political spectrum, and yet we still come out on top as if this was all just a minor inconvenience.  #HEY REDDIT, JUST A FRIENDLY REMINDER: DONALD "GOD EMPEROR" TRUMP IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU FILTER US OR CHANNEL YOUR BUTTHURT INTO PARAGRAPHS OF TEXT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE THAT. AND WE MOST CERTAINLY AREN'T FINISHED HERE.  This train has no brakes. Let's make the ETA to Andromeda less than a year.
At some point Reddit has to come out and say this website is devoted to liberal discussion only.  It's becoming a joke.

Its like when the NBA changed the rules to try to stop Shaq
just like the man himself, the more they attack him, the stronger he gets. 
Even if they eventually are successful in finding the right balance of changes to keep us off r/all, it just means we won, once and for all. 
One of these days they will change the algorithim and BAM JEB SURGE!!!!!!!
It just warms my heart to think that this man's presidential run/victory is actively breaking the act of censorship on a website that was designed for free speech and was designed on a democratic voting system. If Hillary had won, and her face was all over the front page, and every user on Reddit was upvoting her, you think Reddit would even consider altering their algorithms? It just makes it 1000 times better knowing that people, especially the Reddit (and other social media) admins, who hate this man's guts are going to have to deal with him for at least 4 more years, while the better half of their users actively oppose their views. The fascist-like steps they are taking to combat free speech and ideas/arguments that they have not deemed appropriate by their globalist god-kings will only become more apparent, and madden more and more individual users, as Trump's presidency moves forward.
The subreddits that got filtered the fastest were /r/politics /r/science and /r/atheism, probably for very similar reasons.     Now all I ever see on the /r/all page is "Donald Trump" and "x000 new jobs" which makes Reddit worth reading again.   
Im amazed that those who edit the source code are having a hard time with this. It seems like Reddit is a weekend project for them, that they kinda half-ass. I mean, how hard would it be to keep this sub from showing up in /all??
[deleted]
Reddit is cancer, but the good part is that you can tell you are effective and winning the harder they work against you. When there is a specific rule made and your name comes up. You have won.

Exactly!  There's nothing they can do to stop us!!  Our energy is just too high!!!
#Where do I apply to go work on this wall?
You guys, our posts honestly don't make it to /r/all as much as they used to. If you go to /r/all when you're logged out, /r/the_donald very, very rarely shows up. Even when our posts reach 30,000+ score. We need to stop pretending like we're still visible to everyone because we're not. We've become the most populated and active echo chamber on Reddit after the changes the admins made. I hate to be so low energy but we can't ignore the facts. 
~~racist, sexist, bigots~~   ~~uneducated whites~~   ~~bots~~   ~~gaming the system~~   Winners keep winning.  
CAN'T STOP, WON'T STOP
Another form of that tolerance they always speak of...
"Updated the entire voting system." Is that why some of the front page posts have double or triple the usual amount of up votes? 
[deleted]
Hmm, I'm thinking we may need to tap the brakes?
Remember to up vote EVERYTHING except stickies. Every vote counts. Do your part, centipede.  A single grain of rice can tip the scale...................
We should be using this HIGH ENERGY for MAGA  Who gives a shit about the rest of reddit until we have something they have to see
We are centipedes-- the elite. 
They should just change the name of the site to 'Donnit' now. 
 15982 votes now. 59% upvoted. Did this reach r/all or something? 
Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come

NO BRAKES
We are still not on r/all tho, right?
unstoppable? more like #NO BRAKES!
U CAN'T STOP GREATNESS
NO BRAKES!
Those who have filtered the Don out won't be able to see rising submissions on r/all and downvote them. In that aspect is helps us.
What gets me is the boys in blue thing that went around would totally not happen without the Donald... Hell I saw anime and star trek subs making the joke. 
only thing left is to finally accept it 
**KNOCK KNOCK**  "Who is it?"   "Singing people."  "What are you people singing?"  "The song of angry men!"
How emblematic of this election. They try to rig the system, we still win.
Trump, ah, finds a way.
#When libcucks send their sp.. i mean nazi's, they're not sending their best!#
Yeah! No brakes!
Anyone else find it extremely suspicious that after the vote system change, some subreddits  (many ets) get more upvotes on posts than they have users (Obama post is 60k upvotes and rising with only 59k users), yet we still sit around 8k?
Did T_D go to private for a few minutes? It's seems back to normal.
59% upvoted!! SORRY CUCKS BUT REDDIT ISN'T YOU'RE SAFE SPACE
I wonder when admins will respect the fact that people like Trump
And they would have gotten a way with it too if it weren't for that pesky freedom of speech. 
KANSAS REDDITORS USE THE DOM REDDIT
**The Trump Train stops for no one!  WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!**
He made it to the front page of Time. You think some shitty website like Reddit can stop him?
And due to the downvote brigading. Nobody is blocking the donald on r all. Lol. 
**UMSTUMPABLE UNSTOPPABLE UNDEFEATED**
They basically have the powers of god on this site and they are still losing...
Suck it reddit. All your bases are belong to us.
High energy! 
So, you go bald when that happens?
I'm seeing way more of /r/The_Donald than I ever have before. Seriously, my front page is about 25% /r/The_Donald  It's awesome
The train kept a-rollin!
The only way they could silence us *on this site* is to ban us... of course the site would take a HUGE hit of which recovery would be difficult if not impossible.
Guys, the subreddit dedicated to THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES is being marginalized.  It's disgraceful.  
[removed]
Idk, my guess is they are just trying to keep the front page as intelligent as possible.
Still unstoppable? I haven't seen any T_D posts on r/All since the censorship or whatever you want to call it.
What I love is every single time there's a change there're several posts on the front page from this subreddit claiming the change is just to suppress this subreddit from being on the front page.  After the 2nd or 3rd time I would like to think that people would start thinking "Oh wait, maybe it's not a conspiracy against us and they're just changing how their site works" but I mean what would I know?
That's because updating their system constantly is part of their job, not a coordinated effort to take down the_donald.
Yes this ten thousand times over, then tell them how much not getting your way hurts your fee fees.

Do they not realize that the more they attempt to censor us, the stronger and swifter we will retaliate? Just like how they've recently been doubling/tripling down on all the race-baiting, fear-mongering bullshit that lost them the election, they will continue to shoot themselves in the foot until the overwhelming majority of stakeholders forces the admins to restore free speech.

Downvote me tell hell if you please but I don't think it's necessarily about that. I get on Reddit to see what the world is up to. I want to see the best stupid cat gifs, read about where technology is going, and see what the world news is like when people from that specific area chime in, among other things. America voted for Trump and thats fine by me.  However, I don't like being spammed with Trump all over r/all. I don't think this is necessarily a political thing but more of a "let's keep Reddit for what Reddit is" and to me that means not spamming your opinions constantly and instead reading what others genuinely have to say whether or not you agree with them. Going to add I admire your passion but maybe show it in a different way?
Reddit employees always knew how much karma a post has....obviously. Hell, OP would know as the actual karma was always 1:1.   The main reason they made the change to actually showing all the votes is for advertisers. It shows how large reddit really is. Posts hitting 90k upvotes in a few hours? As a company, those figures look amazing compared to what we had before, at around 3-4k.   I love this sub, but man, sometimes people can just be a bit silly.
B-but muh bots

What's this gif from?
Ssssh don't tell them we've gained sentience, just leave it at them thinking we are bots.  
I just checked over there. They basically ganked our style. The mannerisms of our posts, "get this to the top!" they really just lifted everything about this dom and applied to themselves. They even [stickied this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/5gxa5d/ben_garrisons_message_to_rthe_donald/). And one of the top posts is a picture of Obama with the subject "Reddit voting algorithm has changed. Will this picture of the greatest president ever be the new highest voted post of all time?" And top comment is like "Come on, best president of *all time*?" They can't even stand by their own leader. It's hilariously pathetic.
That's why we're trying to start /r/enoughfakenewsspam
they dont. they get paid to say it.

They have to do it with the appearance of fairness... And plus our mods = gods so we can outsmart them. 
Thats the best part. Its good to be underestimated. They wont even know what hit em when push comes to shove. 
The rest of Reddit is fake news. Almost 60K Upvotes bashing Trump. Pic from 2015 under Obama
So this isn't election meddling but a few Russian memes are?
I saw that picture on Reddit this morning and figured I didn't even need to look into because I would see the actual source later today on /r/the_donald.   Of course I was right and now it's at a point where I don't even need to go research their ridiculous claims because places like this still exist on Reddit.

The vast majority of Reddit users cannot think for themselves. Hivemind.
And any comments I made pointing this out were blocked because I’m not a verified member of blackpeopletwitter.   Spez: they made the thread “country club mode” meaning only people approved with their skin color are allowed to post? Is this real?? 🤡 🌎
Leftists are retards in at least 90% of cases
Every comment i made saying this happened under Obama was removed
Hahahah.  All the trump bashing on reddit and npr turned me into a supporter of Trump.  It made me realize I wasn't actually looking into anything, I was just accepting whatever narrative they were putting out.
Reddit is full of brainwashed retards.
Sheesh, Obama could've at least [turned off the lights...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GnYtuhZXzo)  #FAKE NEWS
They are also blaming the "KIDS AREN'T GETTING TOOTHPASTE AND SOAP" stuff on Trump when the original lawsuit is from 2015 and was appealed in 2017.  https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1142532346530451456.html?refreshed=yes
I’m pretty sure on The_Donald I’ve seen more recent images of kids playing xbox or watching tv. This is like summer camp. Don’t let the media fool you. I always ask a leftie “who do you think built these facilities? It didn’t happen under Trump”. And I always get some deflected answer.   Democrat lawmakers refuse to meet with the other side on the issue. They’re just obstructionists and resisters. They want to keep pushing off the issue of immigration until a new president is elected. It’s really sad. If they really cared what happens at the border, all the lawmakers would come together and make a plan. The president’s job isn’t to make laws. It’s their job.
Are you fucking serious?!  No, for real?!   This was #1 on /r/all from the Politics subreddit and even I was fighting with people over funding for these damned kids!

Don't you love it when the media and blue checkmarks on twitter show pictures and video of the Border situation from 2013-2015 and early 2016 before Trump even became President as if it's still indicative of what is going on there?  They have to know it's pure bullshit propaganda at this point, right? Right ?????  This has to be slander, no?  Can someone with some legal expertise fill in me?  I don't know the full situation of what is going on at each individual location or housing area for them, but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAdWLcwdQo) does not even resemble in any way, shape, or form show what is in the pictures.  I know Candace Owens posted some pictures and had a small video on twitter a couple months ago showing almost exactly the same interior of a housing location in the video I linked.  Don't forget when Melania visited a children's unit not too long ago either where it looked nothing like what is shown above.     This is just more BS gas-lighting propaganda fake news.
What happened to reddit, why is the fake news upvoted to 60k after 6 hours and the actual facts only get 5k after 2hours?
>We all hate trump & what’s going on so let’s use updated photos to add fuel to our fight instead of old ones that only help the opposition  https://twitter.com/MikeZiemer/status/1142844867749588992?s=20  THESE PEOPLE ARE INSANE

#Stop calling this fake news. Let's get honest and loud about the truth; it's propaganda. Period.
Democrats: "Let's veto all funding to border control and force them to handle an increasing amount of people as best they can with a decreasing amount of funds."  Also Democrats: "How dare border patrol not spend more to make detained illegal aliens more comfortable?!"
Anything posted in BlackPeopleTwitter is retarded. It's the only sub that can openly be racist.   No one but black people can post in that thread. They make you fucking prove your black
Omg..the comments are gold. The morons dont have a clue. They're over there calling it a concentration camp and orange man is the devil.lol.
It's sad that people call this a hate sub and want it banned. The only thing on display here is the truth. Thank you guys for telling the truth.

Reddit loves to promote propaganda and ignorance, are you really surprised? Yesterday's unattractive old lady who claimed rape about 25 years ago is now "former miss Indiana" to trick readers so they think it's another woman.
Even if this wasn’t fake news, that still isn’t comparable to Nazi concentration camps and those who think so are severely ignorant to what the Jews suffered in them.
Lol the sub in question now makes you verify that you're a colored person to vote. I showed them my brown ass hand, let's see if they'll approve this POC...or maybe the goal is to get the right colored people
all the best to mr donald trump from INDIA! we believe hes making america great again!
Saw this garbage on the front page of Reddit as I was logging in. Have you ever noticed how much trash is on the front page before you login?  Not just liberal BS but violence against pets and children... Thank god we have the beauty of The\_Donald to balance out the hideousness that is Reddit itself.
Left is already at it w their dirty tricks. First the rape charge now this, just blatant fucking lies.!
These retards secretly wish for Trump to be Fascist, just so that they can feel like they were right for once in their life´s. The Left lost it´s fucking mind.
Time for papa to tweet about this and expose this wonderful fake news!
It was in black people twitter, and "country club only" so if you weren't a certified member you couldn't question it.  Interesting.
I personally don't care what condition they are held in, seeing as they entered the country and these compounds of their own volition, plus have the ability to return home whenever by asking the security to leave, back to where they came from.  It's a waste of money to treat these invaders better than many Americans live and waste valuable tax payer funds to treat them to a fancy resort in my opinion.  But that fancy resort is what they are staying in based off the pictures and tours of the facilities have shown.  And that, here is what seriously pisses me off.  The media and elected officials portray the facilities as hell holes and concentration camp when they are anything but that.  They dont report on the invaders ability to return to their home country if they asked or that they came here for free stuff, entering on of their own free will.  No! They report on the exact opposite of what are administration does and outright lie to the American people who are being brainwashed to belive the nonsense.  If Trump was portrayed how it was really happening on this issue and a hundred others there would be no point in an 2020 election because of the record electoral collage win he would pull.  I hate the media so much for what they report, how they frame our greatest President in a generation.  Sad really.

democrats are the ones who wont send money to help.
God, are they doing this shit again?  First cages and now this?   Who gives a fuck anyway. Send them the fuck back they are here illegally!!  Put them in cargo planes fly them over Mexico and kick them out. Parachutes are optional. Its an INVASION and these fuckers are supporting them.
Wow things are getting bad. Briefly scrolling brought that thread shows the level of crazy we’re dealing with these days.
I'm tired of this bullshit... those people are fucking here illegally, they are lucky we gave them a fucking roof over their heads. If they care so much they should open their own homes to them. Let an entire family of illegals stay at their home and provide them all of the "necessities" for free. Practice what you preach, you leftist fucktards.
And 59,998 of the brain dead dickheads that upvoted that shit will actually learn and realize the actual truth
LMAO they locked it down so only black people (vetted by the mods) are allowed to post there.
Oh gosh. So much fake news exists.
Reddit itself is cucked MSM
I’ve come to learn over the past two years that literally nobody gives a fuck what happened under Obama’s watch.
That is all the left has: Trump Hate. They should seriously sit this next election out. And for the next 5.5 years... get and stay out of his way.
Repeat after me:  #indoctrination
Disgusting. People who believe in that shit, are useless.
Wow, they really can’t stop lying in their rabid effort to fill themselves with hate.
I've never posted on this sub-Reddit before, but I think you guys might want to see this.   https://imgur.com/5pGpYx1   &#x200B;  They are deleting posts that debunk the post and tell the truth. Like holy shit, this is beyond a meme, they are actually censoring the truth to push their false narrative!!! This is so fucked up!
\-My name was always Barack Oboma  \-If you like your Doctor, you will KEEP ...a doctor..maybe  \-my husband and I made a wise choice.

(hint at the top)
I responded and said something like the US government did not expect illegal visitors so they get what they get....  I was promptly removed and banned for 24 hours. They said the ban was because I'm not verified Black Person. I didn't realize I needed to be Black to comment on the sub blackpeopletwitter. Seems racist.
People are fucking sheep
Ok, so are we rubbing this in their faces yet?  Cause we should rub this shit in their faces.  Fucking pathetic liars.
So Obama ran concentration camps eh? Give him another noble prize!
Wow the sub that its posted in is deleting comments that are pointing out that the photos are from obamas time in office. Pathetic
Everything the left does is fake, from news to their outrage and everything in between.
If they make the pro Trump up votes worth less, they are probably doing the opposite to the left side
You will get autobanned and your post removed if you post on those threads.  Reddit is doing its best to spread fake news.
And they wonder why we say things like fake news
Obama wants to take the credit for everything Trump does and give Trump the blame for everything Obama did.    Stone cold loser.
clown. fucking. world.
Omg thank god someone actually posted this!!! Was giving me anxiety seeing those morons fall for that bullshit.
To the top with this shit. I consider this a hoax like any other hoax. It's a direct attack on 45 and his administration. Meant to stir up the idiots that think illegals have a right to stay even after they cross without proper authorization which makes them an automatic illegal alien. Then they don't show up to there hearing to see if they get to stay. I can't remember the percentage of them that don't show up, but it's up there. A majority. Then you have more that are gang members or repeat felons. They get free healthcare. More money a month than our homeless vets, homeless, and our own destitute. FOR BREAKING THE GOD-DAMNED LAW!  How dumb are these people? Why? If they're so damn sympathetic, why not there own American brothers and sisters? What the fuck gives?
And they made it a "you must be this color to comment" post too when they realized lol
You know how many spoofed upvotes there are. Reddit is a platform for corrupt libshits
“I don’t care.  I’m sure tRump does this stuff anyway”  All fucking leftist everywhere
And this post won't be seen, because reddit changed the algorithm so posts from The_Donald don't appear on /all or /popular.  And the subreddit responsible didn't allow replies unless you proved you were the *correct skin color*.  &nbsp;  So blatant disinformation got to the front page, hosted by a *racist* subreddit... and reddit's CEO and admins do nothing, because the lies get their side angry and politically charged, and maybe trick some undecideds.  _**And they think they're The Good Guys™.**_
Obama was literally called "The deporter-in-chief"
#LIBERALISM IS A DISEASE
These people don't want the truth. They are too far gone. They hate truth, they hate justice, they hate true fairness, and above all, they hate Jesus Christ.  Reddit is feeding them the propaganda and lies that they love. A large portion of society are essentially dead men walking. Most will never come to the truth and be saved.  This will only get worse. Censorship and propaganda will soon be the norm. Look at China. The powers that be must control all messaging to explain the soon rapture (disappearance) of the true church into heaven (far fewer people than most expect). The one world government under the Antichrist will soon follow, and all hell will break loose.  Turn off the TV. Unplug the internet if you must. Read your Bible every day. Jesus is the only way to be saved. The time is short
well one monumental difference between those in real concentration camps and these leeches is one was forced in the other is a criminal so even if this was there condition which its not I really dont give a fuck if you act like a criminal youre gonna be treated like a criminal   &#x200B;  reading this is sickening   Lawyers arguing on behalf of detained immigrants said the images help prove allegations that the use of the holding cells is unconstitutional   &#x200B;  the fuck? THEY ARE NOT CITIZENS who gives a fuck if its unconstitutional
It’s really quite simple, don’t fucking come here illegally.  Problem solved.
Even if it’s true I still blame democrat for rejecting any funding or negotiation on the border facilities.
Someone in 4chan needs to spin the Obama Concentration camps and hurl this back at them. I know Jon Fabreau already deleted a lot of tweets so the narrative is indeed having a backlash
Man, even if that was under obama that was fucked up. Hopefully we're not doing this now.  I don't blame illegals for wanting to come here. They need to go home, but we should treat them as well as any other criminal. Blankets, beds, speedy trials...
But Obama was black and thus is incapable of being racist and doing any wrong, come on now, get with the times.
Obama is a sick and twisted evil man.
What if Obama kept them in these facilities as quasi vote farms in red States?
The mods deleted comment that called them out too on that sub. Pathetic.
I wish Trump would tweet this picture!!
Trump need to tweet this out ASAP.
A shame so many people upvoted it...
Good luck even trying to tell people the truth about these on reddit. I’ve posted on a ton of the forums and was downvoted to oblivion. People don’t want to hear reason. Pathetic
Wow, this is legit fucked up. Both the Obama administration housing people like that and the media straight-out lying!

Reddit at it again with their group think and peer pressure.  Stay classy reddit, this is why when I over hear someone irl  all themselves a redditor I tend to keep my distance.
Try telling the idiot liberals this.  They seriously believe we have concentration camps run by Trump who wants to go to war with Iran, and that CPB are a bunch of Nazis.     FYI, a majority of CPB agents are Hispanic, Trump doesn't want war and people usually don't run towards concentration camps.
I am so sick of it all...I cannot wait to vote for PRESIDENT DJT again then watch liberals die inside when he wins BIG LEAGUE
That's torture? Sitting in a air conditioned room with a blanket? What were they expecting a king sized bed and Bol and Branch sheets? Since when are criminals expected to receive 5 star treatment?
Democrats blame Obama-era conditions on Trump, and then turn around and refuse to allocate a higher percetage of the budget towards improving the conditions they just complained about...  It’s time to stop caring what these idiots think and just focus on MAGA.
Blackpeopletwitter is full of lies and retards. I got banned from there a while ago.
Anyone who thinks the border is like concentration camps needs to pick up a history book or meet with a holocaust survivor.  I assure you there were no soccer fields in Auschwitz.
And now, when we try and comment this fact in that thread, it automatically gets deleted because we’re not “verified black people”.   Never thought I would have to type the phrase, “verified black people”
It's confirmed. Obama was a fascist.  Does that mean Obama's supporters were all Nazis? 😱
Some guy walks into your house and complains about how you don't have an 85 inch TV and tasty beer the fridge.  Then he calls your house a concentration camp.  Illegals need to get out of our houses and go the fuck home.    Illegal supporters need to be imprisoned or deported.

Women spend more money but get less results.  That's why it's important to hire more men.
We have the best shitposters, folks
BAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
too spicy! CNN is coming!
#triggered  Goddamn this is such a retarded statistic. Almost all of the difference is because women take time off work to have babies. The only way to "fix" this is to make men take time off as well - some countries offer parental leave where, in order for the woman to get the full amount, the man also has to take his leave. Unless we are going to propose that women should get paid MORE than men for the same job (e.g. a woman engineer with 3 years experience is paid the same as a man with 5) this isn't going to happen -- and clearly in that scenario the result would be that nobody would hire women at all.  But even if we did that, many women (#notallwomen) do not come back to the workforce full time because they prefer to work part-time while spending more time with the kid or they just don't come back at all if their man makes enough money to support the household. This is partly an emotional choice (moms luv their babies) and partly a rational choice - childcare is fucking expensive (especially quality childcare) and the household can be better off if one parent stays home. If we offered free universal childcare like certain western European countries more women would go back fulltime but nobody in the USA is suggesting this. Sometimes the man stays home, usually it's the woman -- but this is an individual choice for the couple in question. If the woman finds that the man doesn't want to even though she makes more than him, well, that's her fault for marrying him. What does she want society to do to prevent women from marrying men for the wrong reasons?  EVEN IF we had universal childcare we would also have the problem that women tend not to go into jobs that pay really well. Go into your intro to computer science courses and look around, how many women are there? How many stick around? Yes there is some discrimination against women but when you read first-hand accounts, it is something to the effect of, Yeah college was meritocratic, and people were mostly well behaved though there were a few trolls, but I'm not going to do a hard technical job after graduation because "I don't want to make one mistake and forever lower my male peers' opinion of all women" (https://www.quora.com/How-are-female-students-treated-at-MIT). More likely, there are simply more men who want to do highly technical work and more women who enjoy jobs with soft skills. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make her drink.  tldr: taking the total amount of money earned by women and dividing it by the amount earned by men is retarded. 
as a woman, can I  honestly and completely say that LIBERAL WOMEN ARE WEAK AS FUCK? Jesus, every little thing is a shitshow to them. GROW A PAIR. 
The number will get smaller when Trumps count goes up.   #+420

But it rounds up to 79%...   They would have know that if they were in STEM. Of course, that "problem" would also not exist then, but then against I am a fucking white male.

I don't believe that women make 78% of what men make on average. My first wife made the exact same as me, same job. My current wife make 3 times what I make. I've never worked for a company that gives me a 22% raise because I'm a male. The only reason I have made more is because i have argued when they are low balling me. Which is basically telling them I can't work for that little amount, and with my training and experience, I can't and won't accept so little pay. Businesses are trying to make money, everyone of them will try to pay you the minimum. No matter if you're a male or female.

1) Your dad looks like a badass 2) Don't be satisfied with the camera shot, pull a 1080P frame down and get that printed up on a canvas. Makes a great Christmas gift
It must be a work out just to walk around with all those medals, god damn what a patriot!!! 
Sorry Mr President, my main medal jacket is at the drycleaners. This is Battles #27 through #112.  BTW, you are probably the most DoxxProof redditor in history. 
Your dad is Supe Daddy?! That's awesome. He was the comm when I was there

A proud moment in your household and in our country.  We'll have a CIC that respects the military once again.
Jesus man....the feels.  Welcome back America.  Welcone back.
Who is your Dad and what does he do?
what rank is your father? he looks fucking amazing and i'm proud of him to be in charge of elements of our army!
My wife is Navy and attending the game with her YP crew. She texted me saying she got to see Trump's hair when he arrived in person but that's all that was visible. Still. What a magnificent sight that must've been
Thank your Dad for his service for me. And thank you and your family for your service, too.
Your dad looks like he has to always remember to relax his forearm when shaking hands to avoid breaking every bone in the other person's hand.  
Things to do:  1. Don't fuck with Jcas11 from reddit's father. 
Even as a Canadian, I'd still like to thank your father for his service. After all, our military mostly if not wholly, work together. And without the US military in this day in age, who knows what would happen with Canada. Thank you!
Bet he's glad he's not shaking hands with a globalist piece of shit anymore 
Is your Dad a two-star?

If you were told that military folk were not comfortable with the idea of Trump as commander in chief, you may have been watching FAKE NEWS.

I had drinks at your dad's house a few months ago. Nice man. He was my dad's company commander at West Point back in the 80's and my dad has told me some great stories. 
Get this man a coat!!!
lol why does your dads wikipedia article say he worked on the Pentagons air conditioning after searching for survivors in the wreckage on 9/11?  "It's okay son, you are safe now."  "Oh the humanity!"  "The humidity did you say? GET THAT A/C WORKING!" 
Your dad is a hero
VETERANS love Trump. One of my favorite moments of the entire campaign was during the commander in chief town hall. A young and very attractive female veteran in uniform got up to ask a question. She talked in a very commanding almost angry tone and you could tell she was very very serious about her issue. No smiles. Very very serious. It was a question but her tone made it feel more like a statement. It was like she knew no bullshit politician answer would please her and was using it more as a platform to spread her issue. She did not seem happy asking this question at all.   Her question (shortened) "what will you do regarding the 20 veterans that kill themselves every day?"  She immediately looked up and stared right into Trumps eyes with the most serious look on her face as if "now what, how can you respond?"  Trump "actually.... it's 22 now"  She couldn't help it but she smiled for a brief second and her eyes lit up. I mean it. Military types especially the women have it tough and have to hide emotion but you could tell Trump completely won her over. It didn't even matter what Trump said after that, no rehearsed BS lines could have had the same impact. It's the little things like that that win a campaign. Not the same old talking points and attacks. It's those real connections with people.   Anyone else remember this moment?
Anyone downvoting this (Hillary goons) should deport themselves. A hero in our military shaking our future Presidents hand.... Yeah F off you insane leftist clowns. Leave our country, you are not wanted 
Stand tall.  
Your dad is a bad ass. Even more so now. Don't we love our service men?
Hit me right in the feels so damn hard. I wish I could shake your dads hand and thank him for his service to the greatest nation in the world. 
Hooah! Seems your dad is high ranking.
Thank your dad for serving for me. For fighting for my freedom.

Your dad's rack is amazing. I'm Jealous with my little 4 stack.  Just learned he is a General with 40+ years TIS. Now I don't feel so bad seeing as how I was only enlisted with 8.

My line bro's know what I am talking about though. *"You assaulted this bunker alone with nothing but a Gerber multi-tool and a wet napkin? Good job!

BREAKING: Trey Gowdy Announces Full Blown Resurrection Of Investigation Now That Elections Are Over… She Is Finished. THIS IS HUGE!!
Hey centipedes! I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but as of right now we cannot confirm this source or any other sources with that story.   Here at /r/the_donald we pride ourselves at being the first to report all major news before the liberal media finds the correct narrative. But this story, at least for the time being, cannot be confirmed.   So take it, and this website with a grain of salt!
Probably a good time to investigate Soros as well.
Can't wait for this ! Gowdy mode activated .
Unchained Gowdy is going to be something else. 
This is all just to push Obama to pardon Hillary. I like Gowdy, but I feel this is all theater. In the end, it doesn't matter, because Obama will pardon her for Federal crimes, but the Clinton Foundation and the crimes under that umbrella is under the jurisdiction of states like New York. Regardless, the house of cards will slowly crumble in 2017. 
You can run on for a long time  Run on for long time  Run on for a long time  But sooner or later Gowdy'll cut you down

> "It would appear the investigation is back to the status quo ante, which means Director Comey believes Secretary Clinton was indeed extremely careless in her handling of classified material,” he added."   > "Yet, there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt Secretary Clinton had a specific intent to violate a statute which specifically provides for the lower sector standard of gross negligence,” Gowdy concluded.
This is a good quick sum up of what he is referring to.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z8pnk2rvYo
HOLY FUCK GOWDY, MR. GOWDY,      *TAKE.*    *MY.*    *ENERGY!!!!!!!!!*
This is one of those ad filled clickbait sites. Basically all he's saying here is that nothing has changed since Comey "cleared" her. A new AG can pursue charges against her based on evidence attained so far and new evidence from other investigations.   However, we need Trump and the AG to pursue it. There is talk within his campaign of letting her go to help "unite" the country. This is straight from the mouth of fat fuck Chris Christie. Rudy however left it open whether he'd do it.   So centipedes, if we want justice, we have to fight the pundits and keep them from influencing Donald. 
**BASED TREY GOWDY GET ROWDY**
Tick tock, Hillary, Tick tock. 
The Clinton Foundation investigation, in my opinion, is 10,000 times more important than Clinton's email investigation.
Gowd-Emperor? 
I spent 8 months mining the salt, shitposting Don to the White House, and the night before election night made it to the top of /r/All, top 5000 of reddit, and had my post encouraging centipedes to vote tweeted out by the Reddit5000 bot, had 94000 votes at a whopping 53% upvoted (LOL CTR BTFO) and then deleted my account following the receipt of about 30 or so death threats. I won't lie, I was pretty attached to that karma despite not really giving a shit about internet points, but that karma was special to me, as it helped Don win.   That said, on my new account that is like three days old, I'm more than happy with my brand new username, in this brand new chapter of AMERICAN JUSTICE that is about to take place.  LOCK HER UP! MAGA!

I support Trey Gowdy 100%, but is this for real? 
While I am all for a legitimate investigation of Clinton and am glad Trump defeated her, I don't think I would trust anything coming from this "News" website.   Looks like they are just in it for the click bait. Look at the title for this article for example: [White House Staffers Do Something Unforgivable To Trump During His Meeting With Obama](http://americannews.com/white-house-staffers-do-something-unforgivable-to-trump-during-his-meeting-with-obama/)    And here is the full text from this particular article:   "Just hours after Donald Trump won the presidency over Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama was forced to invite the president-elect to a meeting at the White House. We’re sure the majority of the meeting was Obama pleading with Trump not to throw out his failed policies.  According to reports, Trump and his wife Melania left La Guardia yesterday morning on a private Boeing 757. They landed at the Ronald Reagan National Airport in the later morning and immediately headed for the White House.  Reporters were only able to attend the meeting at the very end of it, for what has been traditionally called a “pool spray.” Essentially, it’s a photo opportunity where the press is given the chance to ask questions.  Trump and Obama were not expected to give any comments.  Trump’s son-in-law, who has been a senior adviser to Trump’s campaign, was seen speaking to White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough. Some have speculated Trump is considering him for the position."    So what was so unforgivable? The "Pool Spray"?   This is not a real news site and part of the reason "real" news sites are leaning more toward sensationalism is because they are trying to compete with this type of thing.  
YES. FUCKING YES. YES.   REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
**WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS, EQUALLY APPLIED TO ALL**  **SHE MUST GROW OLD AND DIE INSIDE THE WALLS OF ADX FLORENCE**
NO! Fuck the emails. Get her for the Clinton Foundation and all the criminal activities in the Podesta emails. That is the real crime!
they need to investigate moveon.org and the american center for change, whatever it's called to see if they are inciting the riots (which they are)
This is a shitty source with no evidence.  I looked around and couldn't find any recent news to back up this article.  Does someone have another source?
#Can someone cite a credible source for this? the link is not credible, where was he when he said this? Who was he talking to? 
> Yet, there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt Secretary Clinton had a specific intent to violate a statute which specifically provides for the lower sector standard of gross negligence  Is "intent" even important in the law?   -I'm sorry, officer, I didn't *want* to kill this guy, just rough him up a bit. -Oh you didn't want to? Fine, I guess...  And we're talking about national security ffs!
[**#DRAINTHESWAMP**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFGiZT-MnI4)
I know this feels like a good idea, but the timing is all wrong.  If the Republicans tip their hand and signal investigations all over the place, Obama will pardon everyone on his way out.  If Trump and the GOP Congress posture that they are interested in reconciliation and just want to get along, then Obama won't get spooked.  Then the day after the inauguration, Trump can come out and say "Good news!  I changed my mind" and then go after every person associated with the Clinton Foundation and there's not a damn thing Obama can do about it.  tl;dr: Calling for investigations now?  Bad.  Pretending to want to get along, then pulling an 180 in February?  Very smart.
Comey still has the referral for contempt of congress for lying...This will be the beginning. RUDY wants to be AG and has said he will prosecute her. He took down the FIVE families of NYC...  These corrupt democrats are shitting their pants..BELIEVE ME!!!!!

Uh.... there are no other articles corroborating this news.... Where else did he announce this?
I can't find this story on any real looking news website.
Guys this post has 850ish comments already. So I feel my comment won't be seen or resonded to - but WTF is this "pardon" shit I'm hearing about?  I've got an imagination and can only say if it is what I think it is then why the funk would the free thinking world invent such a thing?

Can someone explain Gowdy's remarks in plain speak?  While the article title says the investigation is going forward, I can't glean that from the actual article.
We cannot be satisfied with just keeping Clinton's out of WH. They have to pay up.

Any other source for this? I don't know this site but it doesn't seem too trustworthy
I'll only believe it when I see her behind bars. Hope this is actually true though.
Gowdy rolled up his sleeves and is about to go Make America Great Again on Hillary's corrupt ass.
Trey Gowdy is a great American man!
Chelsea Clinton is so ugly getting a blowjob from her should be considered anal.
The culling is upon us. They can't run this time. 
Godspeed, Mr. Gowdy. Help us return Justice to the American Justice system.
I had lost faith that justice could happen...this silver-haired man has changed that!
As nice as it would be to close this chapter on American History, we can't relent.  We have to push through and finish this investigation.  
Fuck I hope this guy runs for president some day. President Gowdy would be the scariest goddamn thing ever.  Also of note is this section:  >“Yet, there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt Secretary Clinton had a specific intent to violate a statute which specifically provides for the lower sector standard of gross negligence,” Gowdy concluded.  The reason Clinton got off is that Comey never really tried to question *intent*. For the statute to be violated, you have to have WILLFULLY sent or received classified information on an unsecure system.  With all of the recent wikileaks, I think there's finally enough evidence for intent to be proven.
Is this confirmed anywhere else? I would have thought Fox news would be blasting this shit?  Evan Evan Evan Evan Evan Evan Evan Evan Evan can I get a fact check?
**TAKE DOWN THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT**
Trey, love you man. Now this is the REAL SOCIAL JUSTICE!!
Lock her up!
From this article:   > Trey Gowdy: “This evidence includes concealment of evidence, destruction of evidence, and **false exculpatory statements**—all of which fall under the general heading of consciousness of guilt.”  # Let's visit what Trey Gowdy has said previously about **false exculpatory statements!!**   [When Gowdy questioned FBI Director Comey on Sep 28, 2016](https://youtu.be/VCLRokEP75c?t=4m17s):   > "...weather or not, and I think you would agree with this director, **false exculpatory statements** are gold in a court room. I would rather have a false exculpatory statements than a confession. I would rather have someone lie about something, and it be provable that that is a lie - such as *I neither sent nor received classified information*; such as that *I turned over all of my work related emails* - all of that to me goes to the issue of intent."
Yes!!! The truth needs to come out!!!
Gowdy needs to lay low until after they get all the empty 40s cleaned out of the White House.
\>CNN having an interview with Clinton talking about what she will do next  WAIT WHAT'S THAT SOUND  ###BAH GAWD, THAT'S TREY GOWDY'S MUSIC  ###🎺 ^🎺 🎺 ^^🎺
I wish he made that statement, the article was basically him just outlining where the case left off, not specifically that it was back on. 
If she gets charged with anything from this Obama will pardon her before he gets out of office. Count on it.  That said, we know she isn't going to get charged.
###AMERICA KEEPS GETTING GREATER EVERY DAY, I CAN'T TAKE IT CENTIPEDES
I love Gowdy and I want her investigated too but this article is suspect. 
I don't understand why intent is needed?   Say someone kills someone due to driving drunk?  They obviously didn't intend to kill anyone.
can anyone show me another source for this other than   "American News" ? never heard of this before.  Though, i dont doubt that any mainstream source like i would be looking for is trying their hardest not to cover something like this.
FATALITY
They need to push gross negligence as the main force behind her imprisonment. Just because shes not a stupid woman doesnt excuse this shit. A total fucking retard would admit to wrongdoing on ANY FORM OF COMMUNICATIONS.  She did this and kept a tight lip on speaking of the legality of it so she could fucking play dumb. 
[removed]
If all else fails (rigged system), in less than 69 days, President Trump could legally detain KILLARY without trial.
I hope Trey Gowdy becomes AG.
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR POLITICAL BELIEFS ARE WE SHOULD ALL AGREE THAT RIGGING PRIMARY ELECTIONS IS ON ITS FACE FASCISM! R/ALL HERE WE GO!

Please do not ever drop this.  I wish Trump himself would mention it from time to time.  The DNC and its supporters should *never* be allowed to forget that the DNC rigged its own primaries.

I don't like Trump, but I'm sure glad as fuck that bitch Hillary didn't get elected. Where the hell were all those idiotic "not our president!" marchers when blatant election fraud was going on during the democratic primaries? The same morons using that "b-but the emails" scapegoat strawman bullshit argument to discredit anyone who criticizes her. Anyone with a brain knows she's been bought and paid for by special interests through "donations" to her illegal Clinton Foundation. If they gave half a shit about the country they would have been marching for Bernie when the primaries got stolen from him. Instead they march against Trump, who won fucking fair and square, because they're crybabies.
What double standard? We don't have standards.

RIGGERS
Donna Brazile is a cheat, Wasserman Schultz is a cheat and they will die ostracized and haunted by their complete lack of credibility. 
Now this is a post I think we can all get behind.
Commenting again to laugh at the bitter lowest common denominators downvoting this eternally obvious fact: Brazile and Wasserman Schultz are DISGUSTING CROOKS.
“We heard loudly and clearly yesterday from Bernie supporters that the process was rigged and it was. And you’ve got to be honest about it. That’s why we need a chair who is transparent,” Perez told the group, according to NBC News.  Later on, Perez claimed on Twitter that he “misspoke” about the deck being stacked against Sanders.  http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/09/tom-perez-backpedals-after-saying-dem-primary-was-rigged-for-hillary/#ixzz4YJshE6mw

They should also be prosecuted.    Also, with that nasty Chelsea look alike, once she was fired, Hillary immediately gave her a position.  These people are fucking swamp creatures.
Lol i denied her service at my restaurant 
"Donna debate question leaker Brazille"  "The emails are fake and altered."
Just looking at these two and knowing they got away it is so upsetting.
Lets not forget that Donna Brazile was given the DNC chairman spot after Debbie WS resigned in disgrace -- even though we all found out that Donna Brazile cheated and gave Hillary some/a interview question(s) before her debate with Donald.  ***Sounds about fucking right for the DNC.***
Exposed corruption... then no (real)consequences. Hell, Debbie Washaman's Shultz was hired onto the Clinton campaign the same day she resigned the DNC chair.   Another reason people don't trust the media much anymore, they ignored the story and the uproar was quietly tucked under the rug. 
You couldn't get a more blatantly rigged primary that a news network (CNN) giving one candidate all the questions and answers before the debate, and then hosting a literally fake debate.   Where are all those Bernie supporters that were so outraged now? Maybe they should start trying to fix their own party before trashing the other side that beat the crooked candidate fairly. 
It's all projection. Russia, fascist, racist.  It's that simple they accuse others of what they are guilty of.
Not a single democrat has denounced the fact that Hillary knowingly (even from lib perspective) received the questions to the world's most important debate, prior to her performance in said debate.
Still no punishment 
I was such a Bernie fan that shit still pisses me off.

They redefined the word "Fascism" to only pertain to right-wing movements.   By the end of the year they'll redefine "Winning" to mean losing.

But it's a Democrat so it's OK!
"Debbie Blabbermouth Schultz"
These two  creeps caused Bernie the election!!  
Can I just say one thing. I wanna start by saying I despise HRC. Yuge Trump supporter from day one. I saw it as a opportunity to cast my vote for the first presidential candidate in my life not bought and paid for.   I'm gonna say something that even disgusts me.  Why would the Democrats let a independent stand in their way of appointing HRC as their nominee. The DNC is not a government institution. While what they did was incredibly unethical you can understand where their thought process is. Don't let this fool you DWS is pure scum. They had this plan in motion since Tim Kaine stepped down as DNC chair to let DWS run the show. In return HRC promised Kaine the VP slot.     This was their plan for years. Once Bernie threatened that they made some very poor choices. Though once again. They are not a government institution.  They wanted to make HRC their candidate, and they did. She was really the only one they had honestly. That's quite sad, but whatever.   This is not a defense of any of those slime balls, if Bernie really felt slighted he would have just ran as an independent. He would have definitely made the threshold for the debates, and he could have not only exposed Hillary for what she did. He could have actually looked respectable and dignified instead of letting the DNC make him look like a bitch.   I just wanted to say that the DNC was going to do everything they could to make sure HRC was the candidate. DWS is a piece of shit who just followed the plans set in place after the 08 election. 
It bothers me that Democrats are not more upset about this.   When Obama won his first term he gave Hillary a choice cabinet post. After he beat her in the primary and selected his VP Biden immediately said he wouldn't run at the end of Obama's term.   So, as far back as 2008, the Democrats were setting the stage for Hillary to run for President by getting Biden to agree not to run (because VP's usually get preference) as a price for being selected as VP. And Obama gave Hillary Executive Level experience which was  one of her weak areas in the election.   And as we saw, no one came forward to run against Hillary. The field was completely clear until finally Sanders threw his hat in.   How is that even possible that at a time when Democrats thought they would have an advantage in the election that more Democrats didn't want to run and take advantage of it?   Because the Clintons ran them off with the help of the DNC. I don't have any proof of that earlier collusion but we do have hard evidence of it later on when the Schultz aided Hillary and undermined Sanders.   For the last 8 years the Democratic Party had been conspiring to undermine and limit the choices of the American Voters. They hand picked a candidate and ensured she would be the only one who could win.   Contrast this to Trump who fought against 18 other candidates. No one can say that the Republicans didn't get to really choose who they wanted. No one spoon fed Republicans the candidate they wanted us to select. And because Trump fought all those other candidates it made him stronger and most of the mud was already slung by the time Hillary got her turn.   Hillary couldn't say the same. Had she actually had a field of candidates to throw mud then much of the ammunition against her would have been worn out by the time of the General Election.   The DNC essentially laid it's cape on a puddle and said, "M'lady?" and tried to give Hillary a pass to the White House. 
SHARIABLUE AND CUCKS BRIGADING.  DO YOUR PART IN THE GREAT WAR AND UPVOTE
2016 BERNIE WAS CHEATED NEVER 4GET
Let's not contribute to the misuse of the word "fascism".   I mean technically, the democrats can rig their election however they want. It's not a government election. If they wanted to, they could have no primary and let an elite board autonomously pick the candidate. They just aren't honest enough to do it that way.

I know people will think that's extreme but in my opinion this equates to treason.  Pedophiles should also be executed.  When pizzagate breaks open they should have a public execution of all those found guilty.  Pedophiles should have to think twice before they decide to molest a child.  "Hmm.. if I have sex with this child, i will be killed if caught."  This is a no brainer to me and the fact that it's not a policy already is astounding.

["Trump will be a formidable opponent... has his finger on the pulse of America...can take key battleground states from us..." - Bill Clinton in February to the NYTimes](https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/59194).   I'm never going to stop posting this wikileaks email. It should be a Daily Reminder. It proves the NYTimes had access to accurate analysis that accurately predicted that Trump would take the states Obama held in 2008\2012. Even when he lost Iowa to Cruz he was winning all the opening primary states, meaning he was stealing democrats. They all knew it, but they executed the Clinton's smear campaign anyway.   
I love when he does this. It inspires me in real life.

My biggest fear was that Trump would quit being Trump. I'm glad he is still fighting the good fight. 
Twitter is being used as a modern day fireside chat. Pulling an effective tactic from Roosevelt with modern media. I hope he keeps doing in a presidential capacity, it's quick, it skips all the fan faire of him making a speech and it focuses an entire nation on what to zero in on next.
Fuck it. Are you guys still doing the coat thing? I considered jumping ship when Hillary fucked Bernie but I just became apathetic. Now that I'm looking into the man and I'm seeing how moderate he's being since winning, I think I'd like to board the train. The DNC is fucking dead and destroyed themselves over this shit. Is it too late for me to join in on the MAGAing? The chaos from the past few days has made me feel the high energy.

So fuck any of these MSM outlets that were fine ruining another person's life with unsubstantiated bullshit.

#That sucks. Hope the same doesn't happen to CNN and MSNBC
More and more Evidence/indicators are coming in that these Protests are not organic, and are pre-planned, large scale organized(such as being bussed around and ordered on the ground), 100% Soros/DNC created and that Hillary gave the order to activate.  BLM was a test run for these Protests and shares alot of similarities tactics wise. If you consider the O'Keefe videos this looks like a large scale "incident violence at rally's using crazy people" aswell.

I honestly think this is the only subreddit that isn't full of shit, maybe besides r/earthporn
THIS IS THE TRUMP WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE.  Never change!
Hahaha, taking time out of his busy schedule to shit on the failing NYT. Good for him!
#PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL CONTINUE SHITPOSTING!  Seriously we need a president trump official channel where every week he addresses questions to the nation directly and alternatively. NO PRESS. Its like nintendo direct. H
#PRESIDENT SHITPOSTER
6:16 AM this man is shitposting and probably up and about. at 6:16AM I'm in bed deciding if my job is worth me getting out of bed.. and I'm 23. #MadMan

I hope he forms an "Office of Shitposting" and makes it an official part of the [White House Communications Agency.](http://disa.mil/careers/whca)
Shitposter-in-chief  I love it!
I think it is great that we now have a president willing to hold the media to a higher standard.
Copypasta   "Now that you've met George Soros I suppose your wondering why he would do something so terrible to so many people.....  Please read  https://i.sli.mg/KBEF6f.jpg"
Damn. I'm not sure if I've ever seen so much hate for a president seen in the twitter comments. Shameful.
I wish NYT came in double-ply
The pro Trump pundits on tv need to just start making fun of the lunatic left. Just laugh at them. 
**My biggest fear is quelled 'pedes**  #The Shitposting will continue! 
This is literally the definition of no brakes.

Wow... I didn't realize the NYT still *had* "thousands of subscribers"! Must be a bunch of dead people... like half of the Democrat's base.
We elected a fucking beautiful son of a gun. I am astonished and I literally have been waking up with a raging boner ever since. Its like a shot of adrenaline. Or viagra I guess. 
Wikileaks turned up written evidence that slander of Trump and his supporters was a strategic choice, in which the New York Times enthusiastically co-operated.  There are many emails, this is just a sample.  The following is a quote from a verified email from Patrick Healy, National Political Correspondent, New York Times, to members of the Clinton campaign.  Circulation information is available, as well.  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/59194  >We're told that President Clinton (like Mrs. Clinton and some other Dems)  thinks that Trump would be a formidable opponent in the general election,  and that Dems are in a form of denial if they dismiss Trump as a joke who  would be easily defeated in November. President Clinton, like others,  thinks that Trump has his finger on the pulse of the electorate's mood and  that only a well-financed, concerted campaign portrayed [sic] him as dangerous  and bigoted will win what both Clintons believe will be a close November  election.   >We're told that President Clinton (like Mrs. Clinton and many other Dems)  thinks the single greatest weapon against Trump is Trump's own instinct to make outrageous, divisive, even hateful comments that can come across as  unpresidential. He, Mrs. Clinton, and the campaign all agree that they will need to seize on opportunities to paint Trump as extremist and recklessly impulsive.   The Clintons themselves chose a campaign of slander BECAUSE they knew DJT would be a formidable candidate.

We literally have a Shitposter-in-Chief now. God Bless America!
Presidential shitposting 
that feel when you spend all election cycle talking shit about someone, and he becomes the most powerful man in the world  the ultimate cucks, the NYT
Fuck the New York Times. Fuck these smug champagne leftists with Ivy league degrees who love the smell of their own farts.  They couldn't be more out of touch with the nation, with the poor, with the masses of people in places like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio who they blindly accuse of bigotry.   These pricks have the audacity to call poor whites privileged and accuse them of being monsters for not wanting to be displaced by an influx of foreigners in their own country. Meanwhile their rich parents are paying their rent on their $2800/month studio apartment on the upper west side and they've never met a minority outside of the bubble of elite institutions they've peacefully incubated in for their entire lives.   The cultural marxist rot has overtaken our major institutions at the national level. The American University has banished critical reasoning in favor of propagandizing our youth to believe an ever evolving web of contradictory statements about race, wealth, power, and privilege in society.  Sorry but for those of us who don't prioritize the approval of talking heads on the major news networks over the lives and futures of our friends, families, and children your propaganda doesn't work. I don't care if Rachel Maddow thinks I'm uneducated. I don't care if Lena Dunham thinks I'm racist. I care if my brother can find a job. I care if my white niece gets to grow up in a society that doesn't tell her she's an oppressor and a villain just because of what womb she came out of. 
It's almost as if people don't like being lied to... *gasp*
When independents and republicans claimed the media was biased to the left, democrats shouted "Noooooooo we aren't."  But now every MSM paper and tv show is shocked, confused, saddened. So I'd say they pretty much confirmed whose camp they were in finally.   The NYT will survive for the elites l, but most journalism is sadly dead already.  
As a subreddit, can we just agree to no longer buy NYT? I HAD TO BUY A FUCKING SAN FRANCSICO CHRONICLE ELECTION DAY TO GET A COVER PHOTO THAT HAD TRUMP ON IT. THE FUCKING SF CHRONICLE. ARE YOU KIDDING NYT?!?  Boycott NYT and CNN. Let there pockets bleed and their tears fill our chalice.
The grey lady and the crooked lady have met their fate. God is good.
I truly hope that all news outlets that gave material support to the Clinton machine will have their white house press credential revoked. As a journalist, you have a great deal of protection under the glorious banner of the 1st amendment, but much less so as a paid political operative. 
There goes that President elect shit posting again 
THE ABSOLUTE MADMAN
#Don't let up, don't give them an inch of breathing room!
So happy he didn't just forgive and forget about nytimes. They need to be made an example of, hopefully soon. Fingers crossed.
I fucking love this man and this year. All our dreams have come true, Centipedes. 
I am going to enjoy watching the media get curb stomped by Trump for the next eight years. Many in the media broke election laws and need to pay a serious price!  
The White House correspondents dinner will just be one giant shitpost
Politically correct   Politically incorrect  <----- This one
Oh, gosh I wish I could travel back in time and post this tweet in June in r/politics.  
Maybe it's time for the NY Times to go out of business.
That's what happens when you get caught taking money to fake news
If the Times was serious about changing their ways, they would replace the editors and writers who took them to this low point.   Or we simply quote The Man himself:  YOU'RE FIRED!

I really enjoy the comments from people complaining that he tweeted. 
HAHAHAHA THE MADMAN NEVER STOPS
The top post on Reddit is a shitpost by President Trump. We really did it
Trump grabbing the media by the pussy.

Rigging the Election – Video III: Creamer Confirms Hillary Clinton Involvement
"Don't repeat that to anybody"  #YOU FUCKED UP MOTHERFUCKER
[deleted]
IT'S HAPPENING!!!! Bob Creamer says Hillary made final decision on one of their protests: 'In the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, who wanted ducks on the ground, so, by god, we will get ducks on the ground. Don't repeat that to anybody.' COLLUSION!
**SPREAD THIS VIDEO AND ALSO THE FACT THAT CREAMER VISITED THE WHITE HOUSE OVER 300 TIMES AND VISITED OBAMA DIRECTLY OVER 40 TIMES DURING HIS PRESIDENCY. THESE TWO THINGS ARE VERY CLEARLY LINKED!**
This video literally proves Hillary Clinton commited FEC violations. I can't wait to see the mainstream media desperately defending this.
Holy shit I'm half way through and these fuckers are saying Clinton wants this, Clinton wants that, all the time.  She can't dodge this.
uh, am I the only one who was completely unaware of the donald duck thing?  they're so giddy over this in the video like it will be a smash hit and absolutely destroy trump  I swear I haven't seen it once in any media outlets  edit for visibility: https://sli.mg/s0FYc1
He is looking at them
I highly recommend [contacting Disney](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/contact-us/) with a link to this video to inform them that their character's reputation has been damaged through these people's actions. They take their licensing and intellectual property very, very, very seriously and this really does hurt the character's image in the public's eyes.  'We're not using for commercial purposes' doesn't matter. Get them to sue, just like he said.

The point:  1) Hillary campaign illegally coordinating with super pacs    2) Hillary campaign directly working with the BIRD DOGGING VOTE RIGGING people.   The three vids go together.  Hillary is working with the BIRD DOGGERS directly.  Hillary CAN NOT DODGE the image of the bleeding police.  SHE KNEW AND SHE WORKED WITH THEM.  Fuck a duck this this the story.    ***HILLARY WORKS WITH THE MEN WHO PAID THUGS TO ATTACK COPS IN CHICAGO AND MAKE BLOOD FLOW DOWN THEIR FACES***     Somone figure out how to edit a video properly that shows:  1) Bob Cramer coordinated bleeding cops    2) Hillary works directly with Bob Cramer  I love o keefe but come on guys, team effort let's go.  Edit:    The script:  1-  This summer, violent protestors disrupted a political event in America.  This is unprecedented, and many good Americans, including police, were badly injured.  The media tried to blame Donald Trump.    2- However it has now been revealed that this man, Bob Creamer, was responsible.  He organized the violence and paid the thugs, at the bidding of Hillary Clinton.      3-  Clinton's campaign has tried to claim that the two don't work together.  However, new evidence has emerged showing a very close relationship.  Hillary even suggested ideas to Bob Creamer for further disruptions.  He takes his orders from Hillary, and those orders lead to injured Americans, a disrupted and rigged political process, and blood running down the faces of American police officers.     4-  Pictures of violence with Hillary in split screen doing her evil smile.    I CAN'T EDIT VIDEO.  CAN SOMEONE MAKE THIS?

#Everyone stop focusing on the ducks and read up on your history. Richard Nixon resigned over stuff like this.
This is a perfect example of how bad Hillarys campaign is. She comes up with a stupid idea, instead of having someone around her to be real and say "That is dumb and we'd have to break laws to do it", she surrounds herself with yes men who will do anything. "If Hillary wants ducks on the ground, she gets ducks on the ground"
All I see is people focusing on the duck. That's not what this video is about. It's about the coordination between the DNC, the PACs, and the campaign.
#**THERE IT IS, FOLKS!**  “In the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground,” says Creamer in one of several exchanges. “So, by God, we would get ducks on the ground.” 
#CUCKS ON THE GROUND.
What is WRONG with yall?!?! So many people in here saying it's not a big deal or it's not enough.... that's exactly how they want to spin it! 
BOOM, chakka lakka.  https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/3934      ERIC WALKER of DNC, 5/10/16: "Discussed with Creamer, et. al. today. We are calling through allied groups to get some folks out front of the RNC before 9 a.m. There will be a separate action in front of the NRSC at 11:30 with the message being "Don't Let Republicans Trump the Supreme Court" - mostly being handled by woodhouse / groups that have been engaged on SCOTUS push I don't think there will be a speaking program - just a demonstration. We should come up with signs to pass out. A few ideas (throw some ideas down here if you have them): * Reject the Trump-Ryan Agenda * Donald Trump: Dangerous, Divisive, Disgraceful (my favorite) * Dump Trump * Love Trumps Hate (HFA tagline) * Say No to Bigotry / Say No to Trump * Trump = Make America Hate Again (2nd choice) Luis and Mark - as our national spokespeople, I also think this is a good opportunity for you both to get some camera time while the media is waiting to catch a glimpse of Trump or Ryan or Reince.

What's more disturbing is that this is the best she could think of. She has the mentality and maturity of a child- which is why she's so easily influenced and her views are so fluid. She probably thought it was genius, while her campaign staff thought it was terrible... which is why there was no msm coverage, someone made a few phone calls to the "media" and told them to not cover that repugnant shit, even their corrupt minds was against this and didn't want a smh moment.   In reality, her staffers are not entirely for her, they're for her bosses and their ideas. They get paid to boost an otherwise ineffective candidate.

If anyone is curious, the FEC violations that were committed are clear http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/indexp.shtml:  >Coordinated Communications When an individual or political committee pays for a communication that is coordinated with a candidate or party committee, the communication is considered an in-kind contribution to that candidate or party committee and is subject to the limits, prohibitions and reporting requirements of the federal campaign finance law. **In general, a payment for a communication is "coordinated" if it is made in cooperation, consultation or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee or their agents, or a political party committee or its agents. 11 CFR 109.21.** To be an "agent" of a candidate, candidate’s committee or political party committee for the purposes of determining whether a communication is coordinated, a person must have actual authorization, either express or implied, from a specific principal to engage in specific activities, and then engage in those activities on behalf of that specific principal. Such activities would also result in a coordinated communication if carried out directly by the candidate, authorized committee staff or a political party official. 11 CFR 109.3(a) and (b).

I don't understand the shade being thrown at this video right now. It lays out a clear case that HRC and the DNC violated campaign laws which goes right to the rigged system that the god Emperor has been hammering home. While HRC is not directly in the video these people all have the same story about where this comes from directly implementing her. Of course she can just deny it but that just plays further into showing who Crooked really is. I do think he should have released this before the debates so Wallace could have asked her about her role in this illegal activity. The video directly implicates her in a felony. What more could you ask for. O'Keefe is a fucking Patriot who has put himself in danger taking on one of the most corrupt people in the world. Look at this from a prosecutors point of view, this can be pursued and charges brought. The American people typically don't know the in's and out's of laws so this video may not sway alot of them who don't think in legalesee. However, what will sway them is if the  headlines reads, "Clinton commits/charged with FELONY for violating federal campaign laws."  TL;DR This may get HRC charged with a felony, and if that is what the headlines read that's what the people will care about not what kind of law was violated, but that she is a possible felon. Also O'Keefe is a fucking patriot and this is excellent work so you better recognize. 
One prediction - this subreddit is about to feature a lot of Donald Duck memes ;)  Who knew a fun cartoon character from my past would rise up to stop Hillary?  I think this is also disturbing in that it's warping a childhood icon, one that many kids today consume with Disney programming, in to an aggressive, bird dogging, violent monster.
Trump is in Florida today.  This is the best place to bring up this video so Disney execs can hear about it.
did 5 years active now doing the whole college thing, and had to listen to a room full of people justify clinton's actions because "well all politicians lie so what!" Its impossible to debate these people, all brainwashed idiots

This went from #1 on /all with more than 10,000 points to #108 on the 3rd page of /all with 5,400 points in less than 2 hours. 62% upvoted.  This is Hillary Clinton directly coordinating with and issuing orders to an "independent" Super PAC in violation of the law, but apparently it's just not of any interest.
Anyone care to give a breakdown of the video for those who are at work?
ELI5: How is any person not currently voting for Trump affected by this? How does bring down Hillary when everyone already knows they violate campaign finance laws and nothing happens? What am I missing? 
I find it interesting how a lot of people here are stating how this isn't the "nuke, killshot, damning video", and okeefe should stop messing around and bring out the big guns, cause he's just been teasing us.etc, etc.   To him, his people spent a year undercover directly in the lion's den. He gets direct evidence of criminal activity, voter, fraud, inciting violence on video and god knows what else, so in his eyes it is smoking gun/nuke level.     What's really amazing is he didn't account for how ridiculous the MSM, Politicans, sheeps, ctr, shillbots and brainwashed americans that these videos would be washed over and swept aside so easily.    Then on /r/the_donald, we understand the Left so well, and all their bullsh*t, that we literally need a video of HRC in the act of committing a crime to POSSIBLY get something to happen.       It is truly an amazing time we live in.

spent some time emailing Disney about my concerns on Donald Duck being used in a Political Campaign.
I feel like the idea of having duck costumes at Trump events is enough to disqualify anyone from running for president, much less colluding with a super pac.
These guys at Democracy Partners and friends are truly fucking retarded.  Duck call ring tones? Rubber ducks saying "Donald Duck" on them?  We should consider ourselves so lucky that this is the kind of stupid shit these retards think is effective. I can't imagine how much money these guys made putting out this stupid, stupid bullshit, my god.

Upvote this shit hard, Centipedes! I've watched this post go from 7k upvotes to 6.6k upvotes. CTR is hard at work. 
What's funny is that the what's being done is relatively tame in regards to the stupid Duck.  But the reason it is so stupid, according to Americans United For Change, is because Hillary wanted the stupid duck. It also shows she and the DNC are coordinating with the pacs, so the previous videos with the violence also implicate the DNC in coordinating it.  I don't think this is enough. They need to have someone from the DNC on the phone with these PACs or they can just deny it.

Hey dumbasses (looking at you ctr) ask yourself this, are you cut out for war? Have you ever watched Full Metal Jacket or Saving Private Ryan? How would you feel if you were drafted against your will and thrown into the meat grinder. Do you guys have any idea how bad your hurting the country or do you even care? When did you guys forsake yourselves and sell your soul. Perhaps you think no harm would come if you get hillary in. I mean if war with Russia is for you by all means vote Hillary but when your bleeding out in a cold field in Siberia with your guts hanging out your going to wish you voted trump. If you want to grow up in the America your parents grew up in vote Trump.

Yesterday was the pretrial hearing in the case of three "refugees" who sexually molested and urinated on a 5 year old American girl last summer in Idaho. The mother of the victim says that it feel like her case is being "pushed under the rug" and "forgotten about." Let's change that!
Remember when this came out and everyone tried telling us that it was fake? 
[deleted]
It's gotten to the point where I ask my dad "did you hear about those refugees/illegals that raped/molested that underage girl?" And he says "yeah you told me yesterday." Then I tell him it's a different one. :(
I remember the prosecutor threaten to charge the family with a hate crime if they keep talking about the case.

I haven't heard of this- This is repugnant.
Due to their economic status, they are forced to live in the same complex as these pricks. They, along with the 90 yo lady that discovered it, get constantly harassed and local Leo doesn't do shit. 
If you have to censor facts and reality in order to make your viewpoint seem plausible, then you need to reconsider your viewpoint.   Unfortunately, the nazi-left feel the need to just double down on censorship and force everybody else to put their head in the sand. They are willing to let everybody around them suffer just so that they can convince themselves that they're good people. It is the same kind of mentality that allowed the genocides in the past, all the perpetrators had convinced themselves that they were the good guys allowing them to slaughter millions in the name of 'morality'  Reddit went from being a beacon of free speech to being the closest we can get to seeing Joseph Gobbel's policies in this day and age.
Idahoan here.  Some of the cities including Boise are getting infested with these SJW's. They stand in the name of compassion as to why we should bring more of these refugees in.  It going to ruin this state and it pisses me off when I see a Chobani sign at a grocery store promoting yogurt that is made locally.  F-that!  Just because you ship people from other countries into this state and it's made by people that are not even citizens you don't get to call that local.

>"Pushed under the rug" and "forgotten about."  Much like every case of black on white violence that isn't livestreamed on facebook by the perpetrators.

39% of Reddit approves 5 year olds being raped and urinated by grown men. Confirmed: liberals and leftists are degenerate monsters.
Think for a minute. EVERY CULTURE has sick fucks. However, sick fucks know they are fucked up and live in shame and shroud their heinous crimes in secrecy.  How many times do these scumbags act in GROUPS.  GANG RAPES, GANG RAPES GANG RAPES when will the left realize it's not one sick fuck here and one sick fuck there.  It's  a  mutual understanding that infidels are subhuman to them.  They are born, raised, and taught time and time again that gays, women, and infidels are subhuman.  How do we react? GIVE THEM FREE MONEY? FREE HOUSING? AND FREE EDUCATION.  What do we get in return?  GANG RAPES!  Do you understand that a group of refugees mutually came to the conclusion that sexually assaulting and urinating on a 5 year old would be okay?    These are the people you are letting in?   I hope Soro's hangs.  I hope Hillary hangs.  I hope all the scum and vermin elites get a taste of their own medicine.   I'm one tough mother fucker.

Deport Them
I don't care if these guys are refugess, white men, black men, brown men, yellow men, red men, green men, or jesus christ and his 12 disciples - they are FUCKED and deserve the death penalty. Raping and urinating on an adult is fucked enough, let alone a god damn toddler. What the hell is wrong with these people?
So disgusting. Fuck Reddit for ignoring this
Serious question, What kind of sick mind would down vote this? 
Why does the left actively try to censor and suppress crime committed by refugees and illegal immigrants?  If you have to distort the truth and lie to make your way of thinking seem legit, maybe your line of thinking is fucked?
Ann Coulter says that immigration is the only reason Democrats keep winning. I never gave her much credit but the absolute adoration of Muslim and Mexican immigrants specifically makes me believe it more and more. The people from these regions are causing a disproportionately high amount of problems for people that already live in this country.  It's not that I don't want Mexicans or Middle-Easterners here, it's that I don't want the ones that undermine core American values. Democrats do because their policies appeal more to immigrants than citizens.
I don't know who is worse, the perpetrators of this horrific act, or the horrible leftists media and local government who are dragging this poor mother and her child through the mud! What a fucking disgrace! 
Islamic rapfugees should be banned from America.  
Didn't the mayor blame the little girl?  Deport them NOW!!
It IS being pushed under the rug. The Democrats know *full* well that every word of this is true, but they *love* rapists, and that's why they're defending those subhuman savages.
These people are fucking monsters. Also, 7k upvotes and a 65% upvote. That means our posts would have a shit ton more upvotes than they have right now.

Pretty disappointing that this is only 56% upvoted. There are some pretty sad people out there.
They should make "the most dangerous game" a real thing. With violent illegal immigrants and refugees as the game.
Anyone who supports refugee settlement in America bears responsibility for this.
Hey all. Native Idahoan here. You wouldn't believe the amount of cuckery going on around here lately. Especially when it comes to Syrian immigrants. I remember this when it first happened, and it's true right now that the main stream media here in Idaho has completely swept it under the rug. It's fucking bullshit.
>“I don’t think it’s fair that us Americans get to struggle and work hard and live paycheck-to-paycheck and pray to make bills,” she continued. “And the refugees get to have everything handed to them.”  This is what we're fighting for. Is that so shitty of a cause that we're all hated by so many? 
Lots of rape apologists making their way to this thread.  Disgusting.

Tweet it at Tucker. If over 100ppl do he will notice
I remember this case from last summer. Breitbart did a lot of articles about this, including the US Attorney threatening anyone with charges of a hate crime for posting and/or talking about the case. The parents of the little girl were pushed aside by the state of Idaho and were refused to be able to see the medical files that were made after their daughter was examined. They were also given the run around by Idaho's Dept. of Family and Children Services.  If this was my child, three families would not be breathing. I'd rather be judged by 12 then to let these monsters off the hook. Deport them all and defund all the private organizations that handle rapeugee settlement in the US. This is not acceptable.
Fast trial, death penalty! Let's make it happen!
Give the family the peace they need to heal as best as possible. This has to stop. Those in office need to be in prison for this bullshit. And the noose for the little muslim fucks.
Deport and build the fucking wall already

America please.  It's a 5 year old for Gaia's sake, but hey, let's not make it about Justice, Law and Order and being a first world nation, let's call folks white supremacists and scream and shout over this 5 year old's case.  America is insane and the goal is to make outsiders and insiders blame each other and the victims; which is all of the American people subject to intense brainwashing and indoctrination.  If we have less infighting and divide & conquer; I.E left + right nonsense and instead focus on issues (which we can actually effect) such as these, simply bringing them into the sunlight and remembering it's not "left" or "right", it's Evil and Anti-Humanism which some of our members of society are enabling and encouraging.  Nothing to do with "religion" or "incompatible cultures", it's Anti-Humanism and Anti-Civilization tenants of the Bilderberg group, being carried out by individuals who are effectively worker ants.
"a 5-year-old special-needs girl" no less...  The Leftists who think they are helping in this case are just making it much, much worse.  This is how lynch mobs get formed.  They need to let the justice system do its work and do it quickly and knock off the delays and false claims of racism/prejudice. 
Death isn't severe enough of a punishment for these assholes.  
Let's hope they get to use the cellphone recording as evidence.

In 1989, Barney Frank got a bill through Congress (Bush I signed it!) that made it legal to let in someone who **was a member of a terrorist organization** and could only be kept out if we could prove that the applicant had ACTUALLY committed a terrorist act.  I'm surprised that there haven't been MORE terrorist acts here.

I'm still surprised how MTV got the most annoying people on the planet to feature in that video. Seriously, I'm not an aggressive person but after that video I was ready to commit mass genocide. They should show this in the army before bombing the shit out of ISIS and other moderate headchoppers.
As a black man, shit like this makes me not want to associate with black people. I'm not an Uncle Tom by any means, but so many of us have been dicknotized by Democrats and social justice that we lose our morals. Quite a sad world.
1. continue to pay me to make this stupid ass face 2. Continue to feel white guilt for something that happened centuries ago. Bonus points if you feel guilt for every ethnicity, not just black. 3.

This hate crime is a result of normalizing decades of institutional anti-white propaganda that has resulted in many black people resenting whites. Black people don't see the real enemy that is brainwashing them into thinking they are victims this is just the beginning.

Remember when MTV was about music videos instead of pregnant teenagers and white guilt?
Blacks will have to commit full on genocide against whites for it to even be remotely considered a hate crime I guess.

police are saying this is not a hate crime.  you can throw all hate crime statistics out the window, folks. they are all discredited now. any credibility hate crime statistics had left has just completely vanished. any time someone brings up a hate crime statistic, all you need to do is bring up this case and that it wasn't counted as a hate crime and those statistics are invalidated.
Are they seriously not charging this as a racial hate crime...? I just woke up, please tell me I'm still dreaming.

**Hey nice torture vid, wanna bring it to the whitehouse and show it off?**
I love this sub so much. It's one of the only safe places left on the Internet. 
WOKE
If you think about it, the YouTube Heroes initiative that allows people to mass flag videos has probably been infiltrated by paid shills for exactly this sort of event, not saying that the real YouTube mods are any less guilty.
If if if if if they just didn't film it, then it would have all been fine. barry Obama is a coward.

We got to instill in people that this culture of hate will not be tolerated. Regardless who you voted for or where you stand politically, we are all human and deserve a level of dignity.

Lets get one thing straight. Just giving BLM the benefit of the doubt and considering the possibility that there a small chance it was not them, Its still an example of the huge black on white race problem and is just as bad. I do believe that BLM has something to do with it though or at least influenced these guys

Look at that racist piece of shit.
I think this video was okayed because they thought the only white males that existed were liberal cucks. For some reason it's easy to push around those cucks.

w8 why the fuck are they @ comet pingpong pizza ? 
James O'Keefe is a heeeeero
It's illegal to watch this video - CNN
Terror plots being discussed at Comet Pong Pizza? What a coincidence
Funny how it became trendy for fascists to identify themselves as anti-fascists.   Send the "anti-fascist" assholes to prison! 
How come all of these "anti-fascist" types are the most fascist cucks around, and they're all ugly as fuck?  Can anyone answer that for me?
just judging by looks, the entire group looks like liberal arts unskilled degree, hadnt worked a day in their lives, safe space kids.
Stink bombs and sprinkler games. What a bunch of weak little beta males. No wonder they spent 2 billion and still lost.
Jesus Christ, we can’t thank James enough. He’s a national goddamn treasure.
I wish I had nothing better to do than plot to disrupt a ball.  These people are lazy fucks living the high life at everyone else's expense. I hope they get the maximum penalty of 5 years and O'Keefe finds out it's still ugly Soros paying the tab.  
The fucked up thing is, just lke every other bombshell, this will all be completely forgotten by next week. We have been having these things dumped on us for many months and not a damn thing has been done about it.  Not only have they not taken action, but even we at td begin to let things fade away. This is is a big deal just like the others and people need to be charged.
Am I the only one thinking this is the first shot fired in unraveling pizza gate?  The authorities have every reason to search the premises of comet pizza 
In Europe we have the AFC as well, they always show up at protests against dictatorship (EU), cultural enrichment (islam) and immigraton (islam). All these protests are peaceful till that unemployed scum shows up. It's the very definition of fascism to intimidate people into silence and their own genocide.   I'm not a leftist claiming the moral highground so I hope they'll get shot one day. 
The lefts are becoming more and more like their friends of the religion of peace every day:  - Violent - Intolerant - Terrorism
This is terrorism, we need to start calling it that

Oh shit- can anyone give a breakdown

Imagine if we were planning these things.... they media would go nuts

Makes me so fucking mad that some people claim his videos are bogus and fake because O'Keefe "heavily edits" his videos  Just look in [/r/redacted] now
Pretty sure this violates the Geneva convention?  Edit: The Geneva Protocol does not apply to conflicts that are not considered "international conflicts", so if anything these people could be charged with terrorism or something similar.
When The Donald hears of this plot, he's now going to get super curious about Comet Ping Pong...
McCarthy wasn't wrong. This is the trickle down from the subversion of our institutions that was never dealt with. The longer it is allowed to fester, The more significant the corrective procedure becomes. 
Hey msm  - THIS IS WHAT INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM LOOKS LIKE!!!  Y'know, that thing you haven't been doing the last 8 years.  Wonder if any of them will actually pick it up.
$50 says the Feds do nothing and they still disrupt the inauguration. 
* Anti-fascist coalition  * Wants to use force and coercion to stifle individuals with different political opinions   The irony  Why are leftist walking contradictions?
If James leads of uncovering pizzagate... He'd be a legend forever
I bet those guy are pervs.
Of course they met at Comet Pizza. 
FYI: The game in the background was played on Dec 18, 2016. The Patriots were playing in Denver and the game started around 1630.
So who do you guys think is behind J20?

O'Keefe said on the Hannity radio show that a new video is coming out tomorrow and it's more damning than today's release.
Here's [Colin Dunn, shooting into his neighbor's house, and bagging a Wanton Endangerment charge](http://www.kentuckynewera.com/news/article_f00561fe-3c12-11e1-bc90-001871e3ce6c.html).  He was later [convicted](https://lynnpryor.squarespace.com/s/Volume-40.pdf).
Who's the mastermind? Why Soros and the CIA of course
The truth is stranger than fiction.  The fact that they decided to plan this terrorist activity at Comet Pizza is just further implication of the criminal activity going on there.  Trump's inauguration cannot come fast enough.  LAW AND ORDER SHALL RETURN TO OUR COUNTRY!

#Domestic Terrorism Conspiracy Brought To You By The Tolerant Left.
This O'Keefe video could be saving people's lives. These fanatics are so desperate to stop someone from improving the country that they're willing to harm and kill, yet accuse those who disagree with them as being bigots, nazis, fascists. Wow, the hypocrisy.
Secret Centipedes are everywhere..  We are supporters of a Constitutional Government(which currently do not have) and the rule of law.                                   These people are domestic terrorists by the very definition.            
Thank god for James!
Ever hear anything about Dr. Ping Pong and Jimmy C. in Berlin? That vanished. How about Clement Freud inviting the McCanns to his gaff after Maddie went "missing". Nothing to see. Nothing. What happened to those 30,000 twitter accounts with pedo connections? I sent that stuff to 7 police departments, all medium sized, all in deep red states...spoke to 2 officers that got it...the right ones...I know I wasn't the only one. What happened? No idea. What on earth happened to the flesh and blood human that went to comet supposedly tooled-up? Gone into thin air? The FACT that the phrase "fake news" was first employed to attack the pedophile/child trafficking information does not seem to have occurred to many. Why did Megyn Kelly agree to have Alefantis on her show? Why? Who IS Megyn Kelly? What about Todd & Clare? Silence. Norway. Silence. Australia. Silence. South Korea. Silence. The UK. Silence. What happened to the stuff the NYPD got from Weiner? Not the bullshit, where the fuck is it? The fake cover story didn't see any NYPD officers fired did it? If true, they ought to hang. So....what? Where is it? How about that pedophile connection in Oregon from Besta-Ping Pong? Remember? Plain sight and one of them a fucking business owner pillar of the community? Poof...gone!    edit: and another thing...Dreamworks having a pizza delivery van hidden in every single cgi production. Still not seen a satisfactory explanation given the context and certain...non-existing degrees of separation...you know, it IS a small world....but it is not that small...    They love to mock us to our face. These are monsters. So many folks claim to know so much about wicked people but all of a sudden they turn right around and say that in THIS case the monsters don't mock their victims to their face and hide their predation in plain sight.  yes, yes they fucking do. 
Hey guys. This is fucked up.  They are trying to kill us, because of their CANDIDATE?  Because who THEY liked DIDN'T win?  What in the motherfuck.......talk about FASCISM!  Seeing this video, it pisses me off to be honest.  Fuck that shit, I hope these people are arrested and tried for DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  Fuck you, you anti-American communist pieces of SHIT!

So much for Comet Pizza being merely an 'alt-right conspiracy', eh?  These scumbags need to be publically dragged through the mud.  Also, does anyone else find it a bit ironic that someone in a group called the 'Anti-Fascist Coalition' is acting exactly like a fascist does?

The media needs to start paying attention to these issues. A huge bust in LA, nope, but Ashton Kutcher talking is more important than an actual bust. They obviously don't care about how women feel.

There are too many fucking cowards in the West. How mentally depraved and fucked up do you have to be to cover this shit up just to keep your politically correct fantasy from imploding?

It's perfectly ok to /r/all Remember guys, they are refugees and don't know any better.
Refuse to cover up Bill Clinton's past with women? Check Pushing Pizzagate as nothing but conspiracy? Check Covering up the Rotherham story? Check Ignoring the issue of rape in Europe by Muslims? Check  Keeping quiet on many of the major child sex ring busts over the last year? Check Trying to derail a presidential candidate with decade old tape regarding "grabbing pussy"? Check Trying to smear gay conservative who has gained major traction over the past year and has received a lot of attention lately? Check  Sounds like just another day for the always trustworthy MSM.

Why didn't the local men storm the police station, lock up the police, find these Pakistani men and kill them in the street?  We aren't talking about 5 girls over a decade. Fourteen fucking hundred. Every male relative and man with pride should have taken justice into their own hands.  Honestly, and this sounds sick, maybe the leftist politicians need to get raped firsthand? What you do to others on purpose, I normally don't care if it happens back to you. These politicians knowingly let these rapes happen in the name of pc. Time to burn down pc culture once and for all. No more. 
They'll waste time arguing over the 1500 to 1400 discrepancy and not see it for what it is.
The real total is much, much higher - there was an estimate of 100,000 victims.

"Trump's rhetoric will cause more of this!" - Reddit liberals
what the fuck is going on here, how corrupt can you possibly be to have this go unprosecuted for 30 years. These fucking pedo rings are rampant and are everywhere. Globalist elites been protecting them for far too long.

Look at the downvotes. So many people actively suppressing rape because of their political agenda
got to love these liberals they'll happily defend false rape cases (Duke lacrosse case) but when it comes to migrant rape statistics they'll say that it didn't happen or it was just mild groping.
1,500 British schoolgirls ~~kidnapped and raped~~ culturally enriched by Muslims in England.
it's an isolated incident #NotAllMuslims #RefugeesWelcome #JustCuckMyShitUpFam
Since this is on r/all, let me stop you rapist apologists in your tracks before you comment:  1. The Crusades argument is moot and is comparing apples to oranges. It happened a long time ago and is a reactionary force to the Islamic invasion.  2. Yes we know not all Muslims are violent and rapists, but that does not disprove the facts that rape culture is prevalent in Islamic countries. The evidences are overwhelming and by constantly defending it will put our people in danger.   3. Asking for more proof when the news article literally already state the situation is both disrespectful to the victims and shows your reluctance to accept the reality of the prevalent rape crime Muslims perform.   4. "The Bible is evil too and other religions have rapists too. Look at the Catholics!" Again. Does not discount the fact that this incident happened and Muslims were the culprit. There are actually verses from the Hadith that supports rape but none in the Bible or other popular religion that does that. So it's basically religion-based versus human sexual perverseness. 
After countless critisism and hate for ruining Germany Merkel responds, "Yes, the future for us may be a 3rd world one, but at least we  can't be called racist. #feminism."
>All but one of the perpetrators were Muslims of **Pakistani** heritage  Add them to the list.
But Trump cited a fake news attack that's more important for my narrative!
There was a gang of nine [Lebanese Muslim Australian males who gang raped girls](http://www.news.com.au/national/courts-law/skaf-gang-rapist-charged-with-knife-attack-tells-court-in-bail-hearing-its-only-an-allegation/news-story/243e20e8a5cca7093c7d24db4f379dbd) as young as 14. The gang targeted girls of Anglo Celtic background and during the rapes called them "Aussie pig". Following that there were [gang rapes of teenage girls by four Pakistani brothers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashfield_gang_rapes). Australians later responded with a riot, but these men all went to prison.
If you don't let them rape, then you're Islamaphobic.  Don't be Islamaphobic.

You assume that the rest of Reddit is concerned by facts. 
They have nothing to say about it other then not all Muslims.  They also have nothing to say about the rate of Muslims who are raping in Sweden, the riots / burning taking place there.  Nor about the riots going on right now in Paris.  Other then to ban you if you mention it like the Muslim mods in worldnews.  Yes, they will ban you if you present evidence to back up your claims.  (Some of them will goad you to link evidence then ban you)
But did it happen last night!?!?!?!?!?      ***REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***
Can anyone explain to me why the world is bowing to Muslims?  What are the people in the worldwide governments so afraid of?  Then again, maybe they are all trying to start an uprising as an excuse to end democracies and start the new world order.  I'm really not into conspiracies but red alerts are flashing all around me.  If you know something I don't, please share.

On 2 February 2017, another six men were given sentences of up to 20 years after the court heard details of how two young girls were sexually abused in Rotherham between 1999 and 2001. One of the girls was made pregnant when she was 12 years old. After sentencing, two of the convicted men shouted "Allahu Akbar" as they were led out of the court.[67][68] 
I've never bought into globalist takeover until President Trumps election.
1500 schoolgirls? Stricter Muslim control, we can't let this constantly happen. I don't care what you liberals think, the downvote button is right there
FUCKING. CUNTS. 
I've never seen christians standing around chanting "praise Jesus" while someone gets their head chopped off or stoned to death or blown to smithereens. I've never seen Christians standing around chanting "God is good!" while a group of them gang rape a 12 year old. However it doesn't require much effort to find videos of Muslim men doing the same thing. Islam is worse than cancer. It is the most vile and evil culture ever imagined. 
The people in these countries, betrayed by their leaders, need to get angry.  Vote them out.
Fucking worthless neanderthals, shit like that really pisses me off.  Could we just have the leftists and Muslims live somewhere else together?
Too bad this is only going to be on r/all for a few minutes before reddit hides this. Then the left will just pretend like they never saw it and keep acting like there isn't a problem.
Well if their "religion" says they could do it who are we to question it? /s
Not single single multiculturalist will ever be held accountable for the horrors they have inflicted upon the British people.  Not a single one will ever apologize and admit they were wrong to allow these people entry into the UK.
Downvoted to oblivion. Fighting the good fight, huh, r/all?
Wish people would open their eyes instead of being afraid of offending someone...
> Front-line youth workers who submitted reports in 2002, 2003 and 2006 expressing their alarm at the scale of the child sex-offending say the town hall told them to keep quiet about the ethnicity of the perpetrators in the interests of “community cohesion”. Fear of appearing racist trumped fears of more children being abused.  Hmm, this sounds familiar.  Where have I heard this before? 
Wow funny how I don't see any liberals commenting but they're disliking all these comments. Almost like they're scared to debate...🤔
ShariaBlue out in full force in the comments 
This is not a reason to treat all Pakistani's / Muslims as rapists. HOWEVER, the Quran does not see raping non-muslims as a 'sin' in their religion, and sometimes praises it.    This does not mean that all Muslims would rape, HOWEVER, Muslims who hold this belief should definitely be put under the microscope. And those that act out on these beliefs should be subject to the full force of the law.   It's absolutely unbelievable how incompetent and cowardly these police were. Unbelievable. They should be punished as well.
"It's actually illegal to assume this is true unless CNN reports it." - /r/all
They're just following the example of their Prophet Muhammad, who married a 6 year old girl called Ayesha and fucked her when she turned 9 years old.
We may just have to let them in and rape everyone before the left realises they're fucking idiots.
This stuff was also my genesis for becoming active on the right.  Back when it wasn't public knowledge (although it still quite isn't, at least it is somewhat reported on now) it was was what made me shift to the right and see the cowardice and failure of modern leftism and progressives.  It also made me realise how little of actual crime is being reported on and covered up, especially this stuff, back when you could only find these kind of reports on shady blogs.  I'll never forget Rotherham.  Oh how far we have come, I could never dream it would be this fast. But we have barely started the battle of fighting back.
Was going on for years. Social workers knew about it, police knew about it and did nothing about it. Was in the news for a couple of weeks then never talked about again and not much changed. I think a couple of people lost their jobs.   Also, a lot of young adults were involved as well, in their cases, they were really fucked because no one would believe them. Police would just put it down to girlfriends just getting even with their middle eastern boyfriend.  
I would literally puke if I tried to finish that whole article. It makes my brain hurt. I literally can't live with this existing in the same world as me. Can we please start up the crusades again?
I was living in derby when the gang in the city was busted. Muslim gangs that are organised just to abuse and rape children are a very real thing in England. It's something that is covered up and defended like these disgusting bastards have a right to do it. Blows my fucking mind. 
/r/all will probably just blame themselves for not being more inviting and tolerant 
Fucking disgusting. The absolute saddest thing about this and it's not just about rape or England. The fucking laws are retarded, I remember as a young child I would sometimes have conversations with my father and I would tell him what I'd do if I caught, say a burglar in my house. Beat him up so hard he'd be unconscious. My father was wise and educated me about the shitty system I was born in and told me "But you can't do that, they will arrest you and then the burglar will get a lawyer and sue you". Infuriating. 
50% downvotes... I guess it's okay as long as it's the muslim minority who's raping these children :)
And they have the audacity to call them Asian men rather than what they are.  Fucksake....
This is fucking sick!  People need to open their eyes!
reddit would care if catholics were responsible.  front page, all day, every day.  but muslims?  they are ANGELS.
r/all has nothing to say, they r/all cucks.
The bigger question is why didn't British nationals riot and demand justice and why aren't they continuing to do so?
jolly bad ol' chap
Assuming the police are the good guys, and are there to help is a HUGE mistake.
>Asian  Look at them and tell me they are Asian 
r/all will never see it, because we've been scrubbed. 
Looks like the USA is going to have to save your ass again Europe.
Damn - I only peripherally heard about the grooming a while back but hardly figured in the news. Why has the media covered ignore up?  Also the Rotherham Police should be arrested. Lock them up
I say   Fuck the muslims. Get them out of our countries and take back the west!
What I have to say is 3 simple words: OUT! OUT! OUT!
Yet another post with ~50% upvoted. Holy crap how obvious can you make vote manipulation?
I'm from Rotherham myself, even since this news came out a few years ago it still seems like Police are way too soft on foreign criminals due to not wanting to seem racist. I've seen it happen a fair few times where they've let them off with things that the English have been charged with.  I remember not long after this news came out there was a fight and the English group was arrested and the Muslim group had their charges dropped, despite seeming to remember the news source saying no one knows what started the fight due to stories not matching.
/r/All doesn't pay attention to anything that hurts their left wing, pc, sjw narrative. 
This makes me feel so sad, frustrated and angry. It's disgusting. There is absolutely no way to defend these criminals.  >Members of the British-Pakistani Muslim community condemned both the sexual abuse and the fact that it had been covered up for fear of "giving oxygen" to racism.[9]  I constantly remind myself that not all Muslims are bad people, but I feel that they need to do more to end the justification of such atrocities in their communities.  And how on earth is covering up these things going to help anything?
This was 1500 kids in just one small town of around 260,000 people.  So, basic maths: lets assume theres a 50/50 male female proportion so approx 130,000 are female. Next we can assume around 25% are elderly, 50% adult and 25% child. So that makes just 32,500 underage girls in Rotherham. So, if 1500 of them were brutally raped by bearded bastards that means approx 1 in 21 girls have been molested by Muslims in Rotherham - this doesnt take into account the fact I bet ALL of them were white - so thats at least 1 or 2 girls in every class - thats how bad this shit is
This sort of thing could very easily could have been done by Non Muslims, *but I sure as hell am not surprised*
"OMG stop lying, all you at the T_D ever do is lie! It was *1,400* girls. I'm going to make a meme about how dumb you are now. #1500Durrr"
Bunch of r/all cucks in this Donald joint lol
you guys are bigots, you need to change your laws to accommodate these people's culture. this wasn't rape, it was cultural enrichment. #rapistlivesmatter #EuropeIsDead
Food always reflect demographics.  Many parts of England are infested with kebab shops.  Traditional fish and chips restaurants are even putting kebab on the menu. Disgusting.  Remove kebab and DEUS VULT.
How I feel when browsing any other sub
One of the top comments of r/redacted I read today was "I'd have more faith in Trump if he'd bother to get his suits fitted." These people are fucking insane lmao
Buzzfeed, Salon, and Teen Vogue are reputable news sources and lifetime politicians know how to fix an economy. 
And down votes for thinking right are the punishment of the day!
Just had a guy call me a piece of shit racist because of the following conversation:  >Him: Disgusting. I hope that shitbag (referring to Donald Trump) gets assassinated.   >Me: I hope Obama gets assassinated    >Him: you piece of shit racist. Reported.
It's like being a Vault Dweller journeying out into the Wasteland. You come across some decent people here and there, but for the most part, it's mostly bloodbugs and feral ghouls. 
I avoid other places on reddit
Reddit: Where opposing views that we disagree with are censored 
#How dare you post *this*!? Drew Carey is a WHITE MALE who used to be in the MILITARY! His opinion is invalid! Reeeeee 
Main page Reddit is like a wasteland of left wing and SJW opinions. It's dead to me.
Because the world's problems have been solved and every solution is more government  Also fuck conservatives they're dumb and racist
But **we are** the ones who are intolerant and looking to censor everyone  
I have posted so much shit on T_D, that would have gotten me perma banned for life on other subreddits.   Seriously guys, some of my posts here make no sense at all. And yet, I was never banned!   So you tell me, which side is more tolerant? 
# FUCK /R/POL1TICS
#WE ARE REDDIT.
Mods, thanks for sticky!  RIP inbox
WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY? - Generally, the left's.
Liberalism: Where genders are made up and logic doesn't matter!
[deleted]
*Literally Hitler*
I have to agree with this whole-heartedly. I left Reddit during the Ellen Pao debacle and usually only come back to read this sub.  Reading the front page of Reddit makes me feel as though I am wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world where I myself am the monster. I'm alone. The past is dead, the future is unimaginable. What certainty have I that a single human creature now living is on my side? And what way of knowing that the dominion of the Left will not endure forever?"  -Paraphrased from "1984"
Lol fuck reddit I'm just here for the Donald man 
Ain't that the truth. 
You Bigot! /s
I loved that show!
There are other places in Reddit other than r/The_Donald ?!  Must be a cesspool of intolerance and hate out there... better take a coat with you, pede!
Welcome to r/politics where they're open to all political discussions as long as they only favor the ctrl-Left democrats
Welcome to Reddit where the points don't matter because The_Donald is so high energy it's off the charts.  Seriously, none of the other subs I'm in ever see posts with the upvote numbers we get, and we have dedicated trolls looking to sink it all, to boot.
[deleted]
More like walking into an empty room and asking if anyone is home. Such little activity on other subs. Sad!
R/the_donald should be its own mobile app. Skip the garbage straight to the truth.
You have to sort by controversial to see any real comments on other subs
I was talking to a guy in some sub about the percentage of people that are gay and got called homophobic, it's crazy. 
Welcome to Reddit where the supposedly non partisan /r/politics is more politically slanted then /r/The_Donald ever was.
I have seen some memes that were literally disproved on snopes of all places taken for gospel in some less savory left wing subs.
It's absolutely retarded how most of these people defend Islam after all that's happened. Stockholm's syndrome, eh?
We have more karma and upvotes than them anyway.
I said once that public schools won't teach genders anymore due to trying to be politically correct and I just got absolutely shit on. Yeah, go teach an elementary school what a tranny is and see what happens. Liberals are fucking stupid. 
I love to open Reddit and see this first thing 
People in worldnews act like the Russian hacking is fact. They literally skip the whole 'evidence' step and if you disagree then you're living under an intellectually inept rock. And you're a bigot.  In other words, astroturfing is very much alive and well.
Literally had to unsubscribe from r/politics because of all the anti trump/ anti right wing spam. It's ridiculous on this website 
I just stick to Battlefield and funny boards..I don't do much else but here and those on this site
TIME FOR A HOEDOWN! 
They love me guys, Reddit is so willing to listen to me.
The sadness in this hilarious truth 
I got banned from /r/PoliticalVideo/ by some nazi mod because I said any culture that treats people the way muslims do is garbage. I got banned for hate speech. 
I may not always agree with you guys, but this is fucking too true.
Yeah, I get downvoted on any other sub, and the "logic" behind it is baffling.  My city's subreddit (along with the province and country) [is especially cucked](https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/5l7zmm/the_end_of_an_era_toronto_bids_farewell_to_iconic/dbuq3wm/?context=3).
It's interesting to check post history sometimes. A lot of those pro Democrat Reddit accounts are new and only post in certain subreddits. The problem with shilling is, it has become so rampant and blatantly obvious that it's actually having the reverse effect on swaying public opinion, people don't like being told who they have to like and who they have to hate. I can see the media hiring their own private defence force one day in the not too distant future.
Nah, /r/KotakuInAction is woke too. 
Don't get me started.  I've been having a hell of a time in a thread on /r/nostupidquestions today  OMG the number of downvotes I've gotten for speaking the truth.  
I love arctic terns!
I always end up back at The_Donald because I think I'm missing another great post reply comment etc. 
[Example of the average leftist reddit user](https://i.sli.mg/1k9fNR.jpg)
And none of the points made fucking matter...
I don't go out there. It's scary and full of Mutants.
Browsing the rest of this cuck infested site, I feel like how Neo must've felt after he was released from the Matrix. 
I dont go to other subreddits, except for r/aww
"…and logic doesn't matter!"
Then how is r/guns a thing.... and r/The_Donald  Both I'm subbed to. Beautiful places.
The rest of reddit is a barren wasteland. It warms my heart logging on to T_D and seeing Trump whispering sweet nothings to that stuffed crust pizza.
I'd go with "WHERE EVERYTHING IS HATE SPEECH AND THE FACTS DON'T MATTER".
their anger is troubling. and then i remember, "fuck that shit, fight back. because they are MISGUIDED.". and then i feel at peace once more.
It's bullshit because I post in /r/politics, am consistently downvoted for not being a DEM cuck and then they throttle me and I can only post every 10 mins.
"Hate speech" is just a word used to shut down a conversation. 
I can personally attest to this. Anytime I post something anti-Hillary/Obama or pro-Trump I get downvoted to oblivion.
This hurts left wing supporters more than clinton's loss 
I was bored so I used my free speech to get banned from /r/hillaryclinton and /r/islam
"the front page of the internet"  lol no the front page of CNN
Yeah i told Technology that they were a joke and should stop pushing their political agendas. It got like a billion downvotes and no actual rebuttal. 
When the dem had complete control of all offices no news story talks about "promises" they had to keep or how the "ball is in their court."  It amazes me how the media tries to skew people's opinions. They try very, very hard. It almost scares me to see how bad it is.
Top 'o the page to ya spicy bastard
I always feel like I have to self-censor myself if I want that sweet, sweet karma. 
Did you guys know there's definite proof of Russian hacking if you "just Google it"? I mean, the government says so and yet won't bring that to Congress to kickstart WW3
You know, i'm not a very big fan of trump (although i'm willing to wait until he's actually president before i make a conclusion on how good or bad of a president he is)... i voted 3rd party because i HATE clinton....but i think a lot of that hate is directly because of exactly what this post says.   this is spot on (as are most of the posts from this sub that reach my front page). the rest of reddit is becoming alienating, and i get downvoted and ganged up on anytime a make a post as simple as saying anything that isn't a circle jerk post calling trump stupid and evil.  in fact i'm pretty sure i'd be banned from r/politics for even saying something like "i'm not a big fan of hillary"   or "i'm willing to give trump a chance, or least wait until he actually takes office for that matter"   or "i think comparing trump to adolf hitler, the mass murder responsible for the holocaust and a world war, a ruthless dictator and leader of the Third Reich.... is a just a little bit of an exaggeration"  (if not banned, i'd at least be labled a neo-nazi inbred racist  who hates women, gays, foreigners and kittens).   i already have been banned from r/hillaryclinton r/socialism for disagreeing with posts on there...and it's funny because all those subreddits accuse this one of censorship and hate mongering. and the worst thing i've said is that i don't completely hate trump..or pointed out something they said that was factually incorrect.   i didn't realize i was a racist, sexist, homophobe, but i've been called one so many times now by the rest of reddit, i'm starting to wonder lol  they are exactly what they accuse donald supporters of. they are just fucking awful people.
It's sickening the way some of them bluster and act so smug. You can tell they are going to be so fucking salty for years and years to come as the God Emperor completely dismantles their asses.
I get a weird kick out of posting some anti-left comment on r/politics and seeing how many down votes I can get. Reverse psychology folks, let's play them at their own game. In fact we should stage a full coupe over there and start an invasion :)
Dude for reals!!!
"Where everything is made up and the votes don't matter"
I think his actual line there works too:   "Where everything is made up and the points don't matter"
I dont even use leddit anymore for anything other than T_D and a few sports subs. If I want to see cucked/all I use ceddit to see if there is anything worth while, most of the alright posts are deleted posts by mods. I usually end up closing the tab after a few minutes. Leddit is a shell of its former self.
Yep, this pretty much sums of reddit.. Although here recently they've gotten away from hate speech.. They've moved to fake news.. You know since they can't think for themselves..
>Welcome to "Whose Offence is it Anyway?", where the genders are all made up and the reals don't matter!  quoting myself
Where the liberal claims are made up and the points don't matter 
Sooooooooo fucking true
I haven't had many issues with other subs, but that's probably because for the most part I stay away from normie shit. try going to r/kotakuinaction or r/men'srights. Most of the rest of the places I browse here are tech related or porn related.
Damnit, why can't I give more than 1 up vote.
and I always wondered why I lost the reddit game (upvotes and karma). I was always surprised that my opinion was the minority and that others didn't share my views (or at least less than 50%).
Build it....  https://youtu.be/A15ix81V4uM
YES!!!! I get barred from commenting in a lot of subs just for disagreeing or questioning the leftist rhetoric that gets thrown around everywhere.

Reddit is basically an awful shitty website, and it's only use (for me anyway) is niche subs for niche topics - some of these subs are awesome, talking to people about rare games, no politics or SJW bullshit involved there.  That is, in my opinion, the only way to be a "Redditor" - steer well clear of the default subs, almost all "news" subs, and any "politics" subs in particular.
Reddit as a whole used to be witty and hilarious. It seemed that every top comment never failed to be creative and original. But ever since the censorship and groupthink gained a footing, it feels so forced and lame. It's the same reason why SNL stopped being funny. It sacrificed the best content and instead opted for the circle jerk.
Ford CEO: A Trump presidency helped up go back to Michigan.  /r/redacted: But that means Trumps presidency didn't do anything because my narrative.
I hate when I find a link on /r/bestof, thinking it might be some cogent discussion of both sides of a political issue, but it then turns out to be some progressive, anti-Trump BS that fits right into what OP says, everything left-wing is fact.
and the upvotes don't matter!! 
Try https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/ 
Really hope this all turns around once Trump is in.  Sick of it all.
Lol yup. I used to lurk a lot and fucking HATED this place, and eventually stopped coming. But then this sub emerged and it's a little more tolerable.
what do you mean "other subs?" i thought r/The_Donald was the One Sub to Rule Them All
I think what gets me is that not even talking about left vs right, but just mass group think in general.  I'm not arrogant enough to believe that I'm right about everything, and I believe we have to have discord and discussion to reach understanding, find common ground, and discover the facts.  The fact that some individuals think that their ideals and feelings are more important than this, really reminds me of a quote.  > “It is easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.”  -Alfred Adler  An entire population of people are too busy "fighting for equality" by means of inequality than to be and treat others as equal.    I also believe the United States has issues trying to be victorious over all evils through fighting (and some certainly have to be handled that way) which just causes more evil to breed, where if we lead by an example by simply being better then we, the United State of America, could be the bright shinning star on the hill.
