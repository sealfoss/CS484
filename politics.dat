> To put this in context, the last time a President was impeached Donald J Trump only had 8 bankruptcies and was on his 2nd marriage. He now has 11 bankruptcies, 3 marriages, 3,500 legal cases, and has officially been impeached.
My representative, Dean Phillips, is the first Democrat in MN-3 since 1961. He just voted to impeach.

Don’t tell me voting doesn’t matter.
Wait, Donald Trump from “The Apprentice”??
Wow...I've been alive to see 2 US Presidents impeached...
Let's all remember:

**I'm not so sure he ever wanted to be President.** He looked like his [dog died](http://i.imgur.com/7WB763p.jpg) on election day. (Except you'll have to picture someone who likes dogs) Melania [broke down in tears](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.html?gtm=bottom). (reportedly not good ones, although she denied it)

Cohen testified before Congress and said [he never wanted to win](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/431802-cohen-trump-described-his-campaign-as-the-greatest-infomercial-in-political) - that he saw the primaries and election as a marketing strategy for him.

>"Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great," Cohen told lawmakers on the House Oversight and Reform Committee. "He had no desire or intention to lead this nation, only to market himself and to build his wealth and power."

>"Mr. Trump would often say this campaign was going to be the greatest infomercial in political history," Cohen said in his opening remarks. "He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign for him was always a marketing opportunity."

[Trump Tower Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_Moscow) is another curious element. It was a project that Trump, Cohen, and Giuliani consistently lied about, and that Cohen was even charged over. Despite conflicts of interest and political ramifications (something a potential candidate would be very wary of pursuing), the project was pursued up until June, 2016. Talks dissolved as the election neared and Trump's political chances and exposure grew.

It doesn't seem too far-fetched to suggest that ever since election night, we've been witnessing what a narcissistic reality TV show host and casino owner (with ZERO political experience) would do if they **accidentally won the presidency.** 

Painfully enough, we're also seeing what the GOP and 40% of the nation would do in this scenario straight out of TheOnion.

Ironically, he now has incentive to stay President because it is the only thing shielding him from indictments. Cohen is literally in prison for crimes Trump directed, evidenced in no uncertain terms by SDNY as "Individual-1". There are at least 4 open-and-shut OOJ charges that would result in indictments, [according to 1,000 federal prosecutors.](https://www.newsweek.com/former-federal-prosecutors-trump-indicted-wasnt-president-1439716) The Ukraine saga that has led to his impeachment could very well be explained partly because he will do anything to stay out of prison (AKA - winning 2020).

We haven't even seen the tip of the iceberg of his financial crimes, despite knowing him and his family [defrauded the government of $400 million](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html) for decades. He also [lost more than a billion dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=27AE398E38DC3D72B25FC7C9355C6E51&gwt=pay&assetType=REGIWALL) in the 80's and 90's.

Just think about it: He promised to release his tax returns in the campaign, only to do a 180 and *appeal three separate cases all the way to the Supreme Court*. This is not a man who ever wanted the microscope and scrutiny of becoming President.

It's insane to think that 40% of the nation and the GOP have a cult-like following around a person who honestly might be trapped and desperately never wanted to be where he is. Luckily for him, he's a self-obsessed businessman devoid of empathy or integrity who has been bullshitting people his entire life. Otherwise, he might not be able to keep this charade up.

When all the dust settles, future historians are going to have a hell of a time writing about this period. I can picture them now - combing through tweets and absurd public statements. I feel like any teachers trying to cover this time are going to have to constantly remind students "Yes, I promise this really happened."

This shows how important it is to vote in your local races. A narrative well worth pushing in it's own right.
>**"We need to make Election Day a holiday," Northam had said in his State of the Commonwealth speech earlier this year.**  
>  
>**"We can do it by ending the Lee-Jackson holiday that Virginia holds ... It commemorates a lost cause. It's time to move on."**

Agreed. I don't care if it's part of a racist "heritage and culture" they are always talking about.
Why is Election Day not a national holiday?? Oh right, because voter suppression.
Virgina is on a roll these days, thanks to all the voters who came out and made a difference.

That fucker LITERALLY confirmed in a February interview that he was not only aware of it,  he felt it was fine because they would be easy to rehire
“I’m a business person, I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them.”

This explains a lot.
I can't stand the current situation in this country.

- Trump can make egregious lies on a national scale.
- Many people eat it up and consider the matter closed for good.
- Then other people provide undeniable evidence - typically quotes directly from Trump's mouth - to rebuke Trump almost immediately after.
- Then people refuse to care because they stopped paying attention as soon as Trump told them what to think, or in some cases because acknowledging reality would prove to be too problematic for them.

The companies “about us” sure sounds like they don’t manufacture masks, let alone a tangible product. This is the military industrial complex DDE warned us would siphon government funding from you and your neighbors. 

The grift is astounding and open:

>Panthera Training provides elite, scenario-based tactical, aviation and intelligence training and instruction for Defense Department, State Department, Federal Agency and Law Enforcement teams who operate in sensitive environments worldwide, to enable those teams to meet their mission goals and requirements.

http://www.pantheratraining.com/about-us/
TL;DR

>"We've done \[Department of Defense\] medical training over the years and  through those contacts with that community were brought sources of  supply in order to assist in the COVID-19 response," Punelli said in a  text message to the Post. "We made the connection with FEMA and offered  these supplies to them."    
>  
>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is paying Panthera $5.50  per mask, which is decidedly more than what the government pays  companies with an established background in producing medical supplies  such as 3M (the company charges about 63 cents per mask).    
>  
>Chuck Hagel, a former defense secretary, told the Post something is  "amiss" regarding this order. "This is not how the government procures  training or any type of supplies. You just wouldn't do business with  somebody like that."   
>  
>"We will provide these masks before May 1 for certain, in full and with a  very high-quality product," \[ James V. Punelli, one of Panthera's executives\] said, telling the Post that the  company is now registered as an LLC in Delaware.   
>  
>The \[FEMA\]spokesperson said that the ordered equipment hasn't arrived yet, but  that Panthera has provided written confirmation the masks are in the  shipping phase of delivery. The delivery is scheduled for April 23.
Does anyone remember the absolute apoplectic rage prominent conservatives flew into over the Solyndra debacle?   Hannity, O'Reilly, Palin, Limbaugh, and all the Tea Party talked about Solyndra non-stop as if it were the biggest catastrophic failure of government mismanagement in history.  This kind of story just is a constant reminder to me of how dishonest all these rage arguments ultimately were.
this is completely awful and unforgivable and will barely make a dent in the news cycle

Good job Kentucky! 
title should be: "Lady who refused to do job, loses job."
From what I remember, this awful bitch owes the people of Kentucky some goddamn money... And human beings, in general, an apology
Guess it was God's will ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
