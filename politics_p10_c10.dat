https   twitter com NaveedAJamali status                        To put this in context  the last time a President was impeached Donald J Trump only had   bankruptcies and was on his  nd marriage  He now has    bankruptcies    marriages        legal cases  and has officially been impeached 
My representative  Dean Phillips  is the first Democrat in MN   since       He just voted to impeach   Don t tell me voting doesn t matter 
Wait  Donald Trump from  The Apprentice   
Wow   I've been alive to see   US Presidents impeached   
Let's all remember     I'm not so sure he ever wanted to be President    He looked like his  dog died  http   i imgur com  WB   p jpg  on election day   Except you'll have to picture someone who likes dogs  Melania  broke down in tears  http   nymag com intelligencer         michael wolff fire and fury book donald trump html gtm bottom    reportedly not good ones  although she denied it   Cohen testified before Congress and said  he never wanted to win  https   thehill com homenews house        cohen trump described his campaign as the greatest infomercial in political    that he saw the primaries and election as a marketing strategy for him     Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great  not to make our country great   Cohen told lawmakers on the House Oversight and Reform Committee   He had no desire or intention to lead this nation  only to market himself and to build his wealth and power      Mr  Trump would often say this campaign was going to be the greatest infomercial in political history   Cohen said in his opening remarks   He never expected to win the primary  He never expected to win the general election  The campaign for him was always a marketing opportunity     Trump Tower Moscow  https   en wikipedia org wiki Trump Tower Moscow  is another curious element  It was a project that Trump  Cohen  and Giuliani consistently lied about  and that Cohen was even charged over  Despite conflicts of interest and political ramifications  something a potential candidate would be very wary of pursuing   the project was pursued up until June        Talks dissolved as the election neared and Trump's political chances and exposure grew   It doesn't seem too far fetched to suggest that ever since election night  we've been witnessing what a narcissistic reality TV show host and casino owner  with ZERO political experience  would do if they   accidentally won the presidency      Painfully enough  we're also seeing what the GOP and     of the nation would do in this scenario straight out of TheOnion   Ironically  he now has incentive to stay President because it is the only thing shielding him from indictments  Cohen is literally in prison for crimes Trump directed  evidenced in no uncertain terms by SDNY as  Individual     There are at least   open and shut OOJ charges that would result in indictments   according to       federal prosecutors   https   www newsweek com former federal prosecutors trump indicted wasnt president          The Ukraine saga that has led to his impeachment could very well be explained partly because he will do anything to stay out of prison  AKA   winning         We haven't even seen the tip of the iceberg of his financial crimes  despite knowing him and his family  defrauded the government of      million  https   www nytimes com interactive            us politics donald trump tax schemes fred trump html  for decades  He also  lost more than a billion dollars  https   www nytimes com interactive            us politics donald trump taxes html mtrref www google com gwh   AE   E  DC D  B  FC C    C E   gwt pay assetType REGIWALL  in the   's and   's   Just think about it  He promised to release his tax returns in the campaign  only to do a     and  appeal three separate cases all the way to the Supreme Court   This is not a man who ever wanted the microscope and scrutiny of becoming President   It's insane to think that     of the nation and the GOP have a cult like following around a person who honestly might be trapped and desperately never wanted to be where he is  Luckily for him  he's a self obsessed businessman devoid of empathy or integrity who has been bullshitting people his entire life  Otherwise  he might not be able to keep this charade up   When all the dust settles  future historians are going to have a hell of a time writing about this period  I can picture them now   combing through tweets and absurd public statements  I feel like any teachers trying to cover this time are going to have to constantly remind students  Yes  I promise this really happened  
Huh   That caller from Alabama was right   They  did  impeach the fucker  and I  am  having a great day 
No matter what happens in the Senate  Donald J  Trump will forever carry the mark of impeachment on his presidential record and in the history books 
 Jonathan Allen  https   twitter com jonallendc status                     s       Unprecedented  Trump now holds the record for most votes ever acquired on an article of impeachment at      He's also No    at       Pull out the impeachment map 
Pelosi just hinted they'll never send the articles unless McConnell agrees to a fair trial process    That means there's a possibility Trump is forever impeached  never acquitted    Hard  Ball

This shows how important it is to vote in your local races  A narrative well worth pushing in it's own right 
    We need to make Election Day a holiday   Northam had said in his State of the Commonwealth speech earlier this year              We can do it by ending the Lee Jackson holiday that Virginia holds     It commemorates a lost cause  It's time to move on      Agreed  I don't care if it's part of a racist  heritage and culture  they are always talking about 
Why is Election Day not a national holiday   Oh right  because voter suppression 
Virgina is on a roll these days  thanks to all the voters who came out and made a difference 
Conservative Virginians are losing their damn minds right now  They hate Northam with a passion  It s almost funny to see themselves getting all worked up on my local county FB page  almost  after reading a few it s just fucking depressing how insane these people are   They re all in on their conspiracy theories  and claiming that Northam is taking advantage of the pandemic crisis to get his  liberal  baby killing agenda  passed  The very same pandemic crisis that they denounced and called a hoax and fake news when Northam called for a state wide stay at home order 
Amazing what happens when you vote out all the Republicans  Protection of voting rights  Not making people go to the polls in PPE  You paying attention Wisconsin voters   you can have all these rights too   
This guy is not fucking around     He should write a guide after this titled  how to unfuck your state in one term 
Also removed the requirement that voters show a photo ID prior to casting a ballot       Voting is a fundamental right  and these new laws strengthen our democracy by making it easier to cast a ballot  not harder   Northam said in a statement   No matter who you are or where you live in Virginia  your voice deserves to be heard  I'm proud to sign these bills into law    We need more states doing this 
It s been an awesome week to be a Virginian  We got expanded abortion rights  decriminalized cannabis  and now this  For a state that was red not too long ago  I m proud of us  Please remember how truly important your local elections are  Fuck the president  I know the choices are both terrible  I m still voting against Trump but I understand why people don t want to participate  But there s no reason to not vote in local elections  It helps so much  even if the progression is slow

That fucker LITERALLY confirmed in a February interview that he was not only aware of it   he felt it was fine because they would be easy to rehire
 I m a business person  I don t like having thousands of people around when you don t need them    This explains a lot 
I can't stand the current situation in this country     Trump can make egregious lies on a national scale    Many people eat it up and consider the matter closed for good    Then other people provide undeniable evidence   typically quotes directly from Trump's mouth   to rebuke Trump almost immediately after    Then people refuse to care because they stopped paying attention as soon as Trump told them what to think  or in some cases because acknowledging reality would prove to be too problematic for them 
Patient Nero
Not only did he fire the pandemic team  he cut funding to the CDC who used to go out and actively attack disease before they spread just like they did on the Ebola outbreak   https   www snopes com fact check trump fire pandemic team 
Dumb     some of the people we ve cut they haven t been used for many  many years and if we ever need them we can get them very quickly and rather then spending the money    Dumber      I m a business person  I don t like having thousands of people around when you don t need them

It's like magic  You can fire people from their jobs and then years later  hire them back on demand and nothing will be lost      Donald J  Trump  Professional Lying Asshole and Moron
Reporter   we're experiencing a pandemic  do you regret cutting funding to the CDC in previous years    DJT   That's a nasty question    How does anyone support this man

The companies  about us  sure sounds like they don t manufacture masks  let alone a tangible product  This is the military industrial complex DDE warned us would siphon government funding from you and your neighbors    The grift is astounding and open    Panthera Training provides elite  scenario based tactical  aviation and intelligence training and instruction for Defense Department  State Department  Federal Agency and Law Enforcement teams who operate in sensitive environments worldwide  to enable those teams to meet their mission goals and requirements   http   www pantheratraining com about us 
TL DR    We've done   Department of Defense   medical training over the years and  through those contacts with that community were brought sources of  supply in order to assist in the COVID    response   Punelli said in a  text message to the Post   We made the connection with FEMA and offered  these supplies to them            The Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  is paying Panthera        per mask  which is decidedly more than what the government pays  companies with an established background in producing medical supplies  such as  M  the company charges about    cents per mask            Chuck Hagel  a former defense secretary  told the Post something is   amiss  regarding this order   This is not how the government procures  training or any type of supplies  You just wouldn't do business with  somebody like that            We will provide these masks before May   for certain  in full and with a  very high quality product      James V  Punelli  one of Panthera's executives   said  telling the Post that the  company is now registered as an LLC in Delaware          The   FEMA  spokesperson said that the ordered equipment hasn't arrived yet  but  that Panthera has provided written confirmation the masks are in the  shipping phase of delivery  The delivery is scheduled for April    
Does anyone remember the absolute apoplectic rage prominent conservatives flew into over the Solyndra debacle    Hannity  O'Reilly  Palin  Limbaugh  and all the Tea Party talked about Solyndra non stop as if it were the biggest catastrophic failure of government mismanagement in history   This kind of story just is a constant reminder to me of how dishonest all these rage arguments ultimately were 
this is completely awful and unforgivable and will barely make a dent in the news cycle
Just like Foxconn got   billion for a factory that never went into operation  but a single mother working   jobs and needing help to feed her children is a welfare queen according to the pro life crowd
 Here  https   businessbankruptcies com cases panthera enterprises llc  is some limited info on their Bankruptcy filings  incomplete as I am not paying a fee to see all the info  but it does provide a partial list of creditors  as well as some of the filing info   Would be interesting to follow the money and see just who they owe  and cross reference to see if the Trump family business has any debt with them as well     To me this seems like a way to funnel taxpayer money through a third party  to procure non existent masks at more than  x the cost from say  M  to deal with some questionable debts that bankrupt company owes 
If we're seriously never going to send Republicans to jail anymore no matter what they do  we might as well shut the country down for good 
  James V  Punelli  one of Panthera's executives  told the Post that the company is working with military contacts to obtain the masks   Why would the federal government of the United States need to pay this company             to source equipment via contacts within the United States military  Maybe I m a bit pessimistic but this transaction seems to be a bit fucky 
  James V  Punelli  one of Panthera's executives  told the Post that the company is working with military contacts to obtain the masks    The federal govt  is paying a private company to get masks   from   the military   What the actual fuck

Good job Kentucky

From what I remember  this awful bitch owes the people of Kentucky some goddamn money    And human beings  in general  an apology
Guess it was God's will

A good start  Next  Congress should require members of Congress  senior Executive Branch officials  members of the Supreme Court  and their immediate families  spouses and children  place their assets into blind trusts 
Trump whispered into his ear  but do I still get that        check though  
   the White House and Republicans agreed to allow an oversight board and create a Treasury Department special inspector general for pandemic recovery to scrutinize the lending decisions and detect abusive or fraudulent behavior  Trump   I got just the man to do this  a good man  an excellent man  Now where is Rudy  
Mitch McConnell was  way too happy  when he announced they were passing this thing and   that worries me to no end     What did they sneak in there that he's so giddy about  I wonder 
Why isn't this a standard stipulation on all government spending 
I lack any kind of faith in this administration     So far it seems like a fair deal   even though i just know what the article said about it     but trump will find some way to fuck it up unless his businesses can make a profit out of it
Why do I feel like Trump will find a way to get that money 
Trump is the only President that would require a clause to stop him from enriching himself from the crisis

Looks like Larry David s schedule is going to get busier and busier   
In a  competitive  primary  as is pointed out in the article by People for Bernie Sanders  Al Gore won in every state against Bill Bradley in the      Democratic Primary 
but can he win with the crucial demographic of national news anchors 
At my age I have had to vote for a lot of different people who didn't always align with what was most important to me personally but instead what was best for the country  Voting for Bernie gives me the best of both worlds so I'm very excited to see how he is doing  The truth is also that  even if my past votes were for more centrist candidates  it was less that I was all for their policies  and often more that there wasn't a progressive candidate to choose from  I'm hoping those in the DNC who are freaking out wake up and see that supporting Bernie is the only right path 
I read in the comments last night that Al Gore also accomplished this feat   is that true or was the commentator misinformed 
 deleted 
I m poor so I don t get involved like this  but today I made a small donation  which makes Bernie the first candidate I ve ever donated to  Even though I can barely buy groceries I feel it s important to support this fella 
Am I wrong in thinking that Iowa didn't release their popular vote numbers before this year  Wasn't it always just delegate numbers previously  How do they make this claim if the popular vote numbers were never released in Iowa 
I love that Bernie is winning but this is    of the total delegates   We need to stop patting ourselves on the back because it could all come undone in Super Tuesday   Cautiously optimistic   I see way too me people acting like we got this   We don't got this   Not yet

  It is all kind of shocking   said a former senior U S  official close to current administration officials     Trump seems to be very reckless  and doesn t grasp the gravity of the things he s dealing with  especially when it comes to intelligence and national security  And it s all clouded because of this problem he has with Russia      NO SHIT  THIS IS WHAT EVERYONE'S BEEN SAYING   Edit   Apparently Buzzfeed is saying they have sources telling them it's worse than what's even being reported by the WP   https   www buzzfeed com jimdalrympleii trump highly classified information russians utm term  cwMBXB XZ  mldAPAwPe    Two US officials who were briefed on Trump s disclosures last week confirmed to BuzzFeed News the veracity of the Post report  with one official noting that  it s far worse than what has already been reported

White collar crime  If Martha Stuart did time  these dummies better   There's no excuse  I work in an accounting office and I'm forced to sign disclosures that I wont use that information to better my financial standing  There is absolutely no way SENATORS didn't   Oh and not to mention they were clearly not looking out for public interest  despite the fact that it is quite literally their job description to care 
In the public markets  this is known as insider trading  For private officials  this appears to be known as insider gaining  The former is illegal  the latter should be impeachable 
Whether they have an R or D next to their name  whichever lawmakers are guilty of profiteering off of a national emergency deserve to be impeached

Just what the economically insecure voters of North Carolina wanted when they sent Trump and Burr to Washington 
This country is so fucked up  Fucked up 
Lock  Them  Up 
the NY Times article   On Jan      Richard Burr  a Republican senator from North Carolina  attended a private Senate briefing from senior government scientists about the seriousness of the coronavirus  Kelly Loeffler  a Republican senator from Georgia  received the same briefing   At the time  many Americans did not yet understand the danger that the virus posed  The same day as the briefing  President Trump   in one of his many attempts over the past two months to make the virus seem like a frivolous matter   tweeted   It will all work out well    Given the disconnect between what they knew and the public s understanding  Burr and Loeffler had an opportunity to sound the alarm  They could have broken ranks with other congressional Republicans and told the country to take the situation more seriously  They could have criticized Trump for not doing more  Such criticism  coming from Trump s own party  would have received major attention  It would have had the potential to alter Trump administration policy and  by extension  the course the disease took   But Burr and Loeffler did virtually nothing to protect the health and safety of their constituents or of Americans in other states   Burr went so far as to co write an article for FoxNews com bragging about the country s readiness   Here s what the two senators did instead  They sold large amounts of their personal stock holdings  cashing in before the market sharply declined  as the severity of the virus became apparent to everyone   The Daily Beast broke the story of Loeffler s trades  which added up to between      million and      million  She started selling the shares the same day as the briefing  She also bought  between          and          in Citrix  a technology company that offers teleworking software  and whose share price has risen since the crisis began  The Daily Beast s Lachlan Markay  William Bredderman and Sam Brodey write   The Center for Responsive Politics and ProPublica broke the news of Burr s trades  which amounted to between          and      million  Among the shares that he and his wife sold were those in three hotel companies  all of which have since seen their stock prices hammered  Karl Evers Hillstrom wrote   Loeffler was appointed to her senate seat last year by Georgia s governor  and is running for election this November  Burr is currently in his third term and has said he would not run again   Their sales are  an immense and outrageous abuse of the public trust   writes Lawfare s Susan Hennessey   It s an inexcusably terrible thing to have done   she adds

   Citing Justice Department sources  CBS reports that more federal arrests targeting neo Nazi or white nationalists are coming down the pike  including people with ties to networks in Europe  Ukraine  and Russia   
Funny     Obama started this initiative  But it was tabled because Republicans  presumably  thought it would  irreparably divide our nation   What a crock of shit 
By Sunday     Trump and Barr have just ordered the FBI to remove White Nationalists and Neo Nazis from the Same Threat Level as ISIS 
Except they should be ranked much higher because ISIS isn't staffing our local law enforcement agencies 
   LONG    overdue   White nationalist domestic terrorists are the single greatest threat to our domestic security 
And Al Qaeda means  The Base   which is also the exact same name as a white supremacist group mentioned in the article   And is also a good way to describe  well  The Base of Trump's will to power fascist regime  Barr is almost certainly one of them since he is compromised by his pedophilia sex trafficking association with Jeffrey Epstein  just like Trump is  whether they are ideologically similar or no 
I'm much more scared of white nationalists and neo Nazis than ISIS  The chances of me being stopped by a police officer ISIS agent is nil 
I've never met a muslim terrorist   But in Georgia  where I live    the FBI just broke up a white nationalist cell that was planning terrorist attacks in the areas around atlanta  These fuckers have the support of the Senate and the White House and are embolden    https   www timesfreepress com news local story      jan    north georgia men ties white supremacy group arrested
